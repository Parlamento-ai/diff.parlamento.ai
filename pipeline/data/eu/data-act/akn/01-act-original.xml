Such technical protection measures shall not be used as a means to hinder the user’s right to effectively provide data to third parties pursuant to Article 5 or any right of a third party under Union law or national legislation implementing Union law as referred to in Article 8(1). 2 A data recipient that has, for the purposes of obtaining data, provided inaccurate or false information to the data holder, deployed deceptive or coercive means or abused evident gaps in the technical infrastructure of the data holder designed to protect the data, has used the data made available for unauthorised purposes or has disclosed those data to another party without the data holder’s authorisation, shall without undue delay, unless the data holder or the user instruct otherwise: (a) destroy the data made available by the data holder and any copies thereof; (b) end the production, offering, placing on the market or use of goods, derivative data or services produced on the basis of knowledge obtained through such data, or the importation, export or storage of infringing goods for those purposes, and destroy any infringing goods. 3 Paragraph 2, point (b), shall not apply in either of the following cases: (a) use of the data has not caused significant harm to the data holder; (b) it would be disproportionate in light of the interests of the data holder.</p>

      <article eId="art_13">
        <heading>Article 13 Unfair contractual terms unilaterally imposed on a micro, small or medium-sized enterprise</heading>
        <content>
        <p>1 A contractual term, concerning the access to and use of data or the liability and remedies for the breach or the termination of data related obligations which has been unilaterally imposed by an enterprise on a micro, small or medium-sized enterprise as defined in Article 2 of the Annex to Recommendation 2003/361/EC shall not be binding on the latter enterprise if it is unfair. 2 A contractual term is unfair if it is of such a nature that its use grossly deviates from good commercial practice in data access and use, contrary to good faith and fair dealing. 3 A contractual term is unfair for the purposes of this Article if its object or effect is to: (a) exclude or limit the liability of the party that unilaterally imposed the term for intentional acts or gross negligence; (b) exclude the remedies available to the party upon whom the term has been unilaterally imposed in case of non-performance of contractual obligations or the liability of the party that unilaterally imposed the term in case of breach of those obligations; (c) give the party that unilaterally imposed the term the exclusive right to determine whether the data supplied are in conformity with the contract or to interpret any term of the contract. 4 A contractual term is presumed unfair for the purposes of this Article if its object or effect is to: (a) inappropriately limit the remedies in case of non-performance of contractual obligations or the liability in case of breach of those obligations; (b) allow the party that unilaterally imposed the term to access and use data of the other contracting party in a manner that is significantly detrimental to the legitimate interests of the other contracting party; (c) prevent the party upon whom the term has been unilaterally imposed from using the data contributed or generated by that party during the period of the contract, or to limit the use of such data to the extent that that party is not entitled to use, capture, access or control such data or exploit the value of such data in a proportionate manner; (d) prevent the party upon whom the term has been unilaterally imposed from obtaining a copy of the data contributed or generated by that party during the period of the contract or within a reasonable period after the termination thereof; (e) enable the party that unilaterally imposed the term to terminate the contract with an unreasonably short notice, taking into consideration the reasonable possibilities of the other contracting party to switch to an alternative and comparable service and the financial detriment caused by such termination, except where there are serious grounds for doing so. 5 A contractual term shall be considered to be unilaterally imposed within the meaning of this Article if it has been supplied by one contracting party and the other contracting party has not been able to influence its content despite an attempt to negotiate it. The contracting party that supplied a contractual term bears the burden of proving that that term has not been unilaterally imposed. 6 Where the unfair contractual term is severable from the remaining terms of the contract, those remaining terms shall remain binding. 7 This Article does not apply to contractual terms defining the main subject matter of the contract or to contractual terms determining the price to be paid. 8 The parties to a contract covered by paragraph 1 may not exclude the application of this Article, derogate from it, or vary its effects.</p>

        <p>1 Providers of data processing services shall take all reasonable technical, legal and organisational measures, including contractual arrangements, in order to prevent international transfer or governmental access to non-personal data held in the Union where such transfer or access would create a conflict with Union law or the national law of the relevant Member State, without prejudice to paragraph 2 or 3. 2 Any decision or judgment of a court or tribunal and any decision of an administrative authority of a third country requiring a provider of data processing services to transfer from or give access to non-personal data within the scope of this Regulation held in the Union may only be recognised or enforceable in any manner if based on an international agreement, such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, in force between the requesting third country and the Union or any such agreement between the requesting third country and a Member State. 3 In the absence of such an international agreement, where a provider of data processing services is the addressee of a decision of a court or a tribunal or a decision of an administrative authority of a third country to transfer from or give access to non-personal data within the scope of this Regulation held in the Union and compliance with such a decision would risk putting the addressee in conflict with Union law or with the national law of the relevant Member State, transfer to or access to such data by that third-country authority shall take place only: (a) where the third-country system requires the reasons and proportionality of the decision or judgement to be set out, and it requires such decision or judgement, as the case may be, to be specific in character, for instance by establishing a sufficient link to certain suspected persons, or infringements; (b) the reasoned objection of the addressee is subject to a review by a competent court or tribunal in the third-country; and (c) the competent court or tribunal issuing the decision or judgement or reviewing the decision of an administrative authority is empowered under the law of that country to take duly into account the relevant legal interests of the provider of the data protected by Union law or national law of the relevant Member State. The addressee of the decision may ask the opinion of the relevant competent bodies or authorities, pursuant to this Regulation, in order to determine whether these conditions are met, notably when it considers that the decision may relate to commercially sensitive data, or may impinge on national security or defence interests of the Union or its Member States. The European Data Innovation Board established under Regulation [xxx – DGA] shall advise and assist the Commission in developing guidelines on the assessment of whether these conditions are met. 4 If the conditions in paragraph 2 or 3 are met, the provider of data processing services shall provide the minimum amount of data permissible in response to a request, based on a reasonable interpretation thereof. 5 The provider of data processing services shall inform the data holder about the existence of a request of an administrative authority in a third-country to access its data before complying with its request, except in cases where the request serves law enforcement purposes and for as long as this is necessary to preserve the effectiveness of the law enforcement activity.</p>
