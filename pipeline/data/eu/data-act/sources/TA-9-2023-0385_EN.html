                                 ‘Data literacy’ refers to skills, knowledge and understanding that allows users, consumers and businesses, in particular medium, small and micro companies, to gain awareness on the potential value of the data they generated, produce and share, in the context of their rights and obligations set out in this Regulation and in other Union data related Regulations. Data literacy should go beyond learning about tools and technologies and aiming to equip citizens and businesses with the ability to benefit from a fair data market. It is therefore necessary that the Commission and the Member States, in cooperation with all relevant stakeholders, promote the development of data literacy, in all sectors of society, for citizens of all ages, including women and girls. Consequently, the Union and its Member states should allocate more investments in education and training to spread data literacy, and that progress in that regard is closely followed Accordingly businesses should also promote tools and take measures to ensure data literacy skills of their staff dealing with data access and use and data transfers, and where applicable, of other persons processing data on their behalf, taking into account their technical knowledge, experience, education and training and considering the users or groups of users from which data is produced or generated.</span>

Users are unable to obtain data necessary to make use of providers of repair and other services, and businesses are unable to launch innovative, more efficient and convenient services.

Unless specified otherwise by Union or Member State law or relevant antitrust rulings, such data should be accessible at the level of processing, including by means of software contained in the connected product, which the manufacturer’s design choice permit ahead of the sale to the user. Data should be available in the form in which they are accessible from the product with only the minimal adaptations necessary to make them useable by a third party, including related metadata necessary to interpret and use the data. This requires the removal of technical barriers to ensure that users, where it is technically possible, will have direct real-time access to their data without extensive individual verification procedures. In order to facilitate third-party access to the required data, cost-efficient access to software tools is also necessary. Where subsequent updates or alterations to the connected product, by the manufacturer or another party, lead to additional accessible data or a restriction of initially accessible data, such changes should be communicated to the user in the context of the update or alteration. This Regulation does not set an obligation to store data additionally on the central computing unit of a product where this would be disproportionate in relation to the expected use. This does not prevent a manufacturer or data holder to voluntarily agree with the user on making such adaptation</span>

                                       <span class="oj-italic">. A substantial hurdle to non-personal data sharing by businesses thus results from the lack of predictability of economic returns from investing in the curation and making available of data sets or data products. In order to allow for the emergence of liquid, efficient and fair markets for non-personal data in the Union, it must be clarified which party has the right to offer such data on a marketplace. Users should therefore have the right to share non-personal data with data recipients for commercial and non-commercial purposes. Such data sharing could be performed directly by the user, upon the request of the user via a data holder or through data intermediation services. Data intermediation services, as regulated by Regulation (EU) 2022/868 could facilitate a data economy by establishing commercial relationships between users, data recipients and third parties and may support users in exercising their right to use data, such as ensuring the proper anonymisation of the data or aggregation of access to data from multiple individual users. In order to protect the incentives for users to monetise non-personal data from connected products they own, data holders should only be able to monetise aggregated data sets from multiple users and should not make available non-personal data accessed by them from the connected product to third parties for commercial or non-commercial purposes, other than the fulfilment of their contractual obligations to the user. At the same time, where data holders have contractually agreed with users the right to use such data, they should be free to use it for a wide range of purposes, including improving the functioning of the connected product or related services, developing new products or services or enriching or manipulating it or aggregating it with other data, including with the aim of making available the resulting data set with third parties, as long as such derived data set does not allow the identification of the specific data items accessed by the data holder from the connected product, or allow a third party to derive those data items from the data set without a significant effort.</span>

They may be collected only for activating a very specific function, such as the activity of windshield wipers or headlights, and there is currently no use case and the design of the product does not foresee such data to be stored in the product in light of the cost related to storage of such data, to connecting the data-capturing sensor to a central computing component from which data could be exported and the costs of connectivity for transmitting the data when volumes are considerable. In this regard, sector-specific regulations should further specify relevancy of accessible data according to their specificities in order to ensure the availability of at least data, which is essential for the repairing or servicing of the connected products and related services.</span>

It is important to preserve incentives to invest in products with functionalities based on the use of data from sensors built into that product. The aim of this Regulation should accordingly be understood as to foster the development of new, innovative products or related services, stimulate innovation on aftermarkets, but also stimulate the development of entirely novel services making use of the data, including based on data from a variety of products or related services. At the same time, it aims to avoid undermining the investment incentives for the type of product from which the data are obtained, for instance, by the use of data to develop a competing product. <span class="oj-bold">

To that end, data holders should be able to require the user, or third parties of the users’ choice, to preserve the confidentiality of data considered as trade secrets. Trade secrets should be identified prior to the disclosure. However, data holders cannot undermine the right of the users to request access and use of data in accordance with this Regulation on the basis of certain data being considered as trade secrets by the data holder. The data holder, or the trade secret holder where it is not the data holder, should have the possibility to agree with the user, or third parties of the users’ choice, on appropriate measures to preserve their confidentiality, including by the use of model contractual terms, confidentiality agreements, strict access protocols, technical standards and the application of codes of conduct. In cases where the user or third parties of the users’ choice fail to implement those measures or undermine the confidentiality of trade secrets, the data holder should be able to suspend the sharing of data identified as trade secrets, pending review by the data coordinator of the Member State. In such cases, the data holder should immediately notify the data coordinator of the Member State in which the data holder is established, pursuant to Article 31 of this Regulation, that it has suspended the sharing of data and identify which measures have not been implemented or which trade secrets have had their confidentiality undermined. Where the user, or a third party of the user’s choice, wishes to challenge the data holder’s decision to suspend the sharing of data, the data coordinator should decide, within a reasonable period of time, whether the data sharing should be resumed or not and if yes, indicate under which conditions. The Commission, assisted by the European Data Innovation Board, should develop model contractual terms, and should be able to develop technical standards. The Commission, assisted by the European Innovation Board, could also encourage the establishment of codes of conduct in relation with the respect of trade secrets or intellectual property rights in handling the data, in order to help achieving the aim of this Regulation.</span>

Under this Regulation, the user who is a natural person is further entitled to access all data generated by the product, personal and non-personal. Where the user is not the data subject but an enterprise, including a sole trader, and not in cases of shared household use of the product, the user will be a controller within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Accordingly, such a user as controller intending to request personal data generated by the use of a product or related service is required to have a legal basis for processing the data under Article 6(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, such as the consent of the data subject or legitimate interest. This user should ensure that the data subject is appropriately informed of the specified, explicit and legitimate purposes for processing those data, and how the data subject may effectively exercise their rights. Where the data holder and the user are joint controllers within the meaning of Article 26 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, they are required to determine, in a transparent manner by means of an arrangement between them, their respective responsibilities for compliance with that Regulation. It should be understood that such a user, once data has been made available, may in turn become a data holder, if they meet the criteria under this Regulation and thus become subject to the obligations to make data available under this Regulation.</p>

This Regulation accordingly complements the right provided under Article 20 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. That Article provides for a right of data subjects to receive personal data concerning them in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and to port those data to other controllers, where those data are processed on the basis of Article 6(1), point (a), or Article 9(2), point (a), or of a contract pursuant to Article 6(1), point (b). Data subjects also have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, but only where technically feasible. Article 20 specifies that it pertains to data provided by the data subject but does not specify whether this necessitates active behaviour on the side of the data subject or whether it also applies to situations where a product or related service by its design observes the behaviour of a data subject or other information in relation to a data subject in a passive manner.

Unlike the technical obligations provided for in Article 20 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, this Regulation mandates and ensures the technical feasibility of third party access for all types of data coming within its scope, whether personal or non-personal. It also allows <span class="oj-bold">

This Regulation aims to facilitate access to data for these entities, while ensuring that the corresponding obligations are scoped as proportionately as possible to avoid overreach. At the same time, a small number of very large companies have emerged with considerable economic power in the digital economy through the accumulation and aggregation of vast volumes of data and the technological infrastructure for monetising them. These companies include undertakings that provide core platform services controlling whole platform ecosystems in the digital economy and whom existing or new market operators are unable to challenge or contest.

Consistent with the ▌ Regulation <span class="oj-bold">

This means that an undertaking providing core platform services that has been designated as a gatekeeper cannot request or be granted access to users’ data generated by the use of a product or related service or by a virtual assistant based on the provisions of Chapter II of this Regulation. An undertaking providing core platform services designated as a gatekeeper pursuant to <span class="oj-bold">

Furthermore, third parties to whom data are made available at the request of the user may not make the data available to a designated gatekeeper. For instance, the third party may not sub-contract the service provision to a gatekeeper. However, this does not prevent third parties from using data processing services offered by a designated gatekeeper. This exclusion of designated gatekeepers from the scope of the access right under this Regulation does not prevent these companies from obtaining data through other lawful means.</p>

Those costs can be technical costs, such as the costs necessary for data reproduction, dissemination via electronic means and storage, but not of data collection or production. Such technical costs could include also the costs for processing, necessary to make data available. Costs related to making the data available may also include the costs of facilitating concrete data sharing requests. They may also vary depending on the arrangements taken for making the data available. Long-term arrangements between data holders and data recipients, for instance via a subscription model or the use of smart contracts, could reduce the costs in regular or repetitive transactions in a business relationship. Costs related to making data available are either specific to a particular request or shared with other requests. In the latter case, a single data recipient should not pay the full costs of making the data available. Reasonable compensation may include, except for micro and small enterprises, secondly a margin. Such margin may vary depending on factors related to the data itself, such as volume, format or nature of the data, or on the supply of and demand for the data. It may consider the costs for collecting the data. The margin may therefore decrease where the data holder has collected the data for its own business without significant investments or may increase where the investments in the data collection for the purposes of the data holder’s business are high. The margin may also depend on the follow-on use of the data by the data recipient. It may be limited or even excluded in situations where the use of the data by the data recipient does not affect the own activities of the data holder. The fact that the data is co-generated by a connected product owned by the user could also lower the amount of the compensation in comparison to other situations where the data are generated by the data holder for example during the provision of a related service.</span>

                                       <span class="oj-italic">Switching charges are charges imposed by providers of cloud computing on their customers for the switching process. Typically, those charges are intended to pass on costs, which the source provider may incur because of the switching process, to the customer that wishes to switch. Examples of common switching charges are costs related to the transfer of data from one provider to the other or to an on-premise system (‘egress fees’) or the costs incurred for specific support actions during the switching process. Unnecessarily high egress fees and other unjustified charges unrelated to actual switching costs, inhibit customers’ switching, restrict the free flow of data, have the potential to limit competition and cause lock-in effects for the customers of data processing services, by reducing incentives to choose a different or additional service provider. As a result of the new obligations foreseen in this Regulation, the source provider of data processing services might outsource certain tasks and renumerate third party entities in order to comply with those obligations. The customer should not bare costs arising from the outsourcing of services concluded by the source provider of data processing services during the switching process and such costs should be considered as unjustified. Nothing in the Data Act prevents a customer to remunerate third party entities for support in the migration process. Egress fees are charged to customers by providers of source data processing services when the customers are willing to take their data out from a cloud provider’s network to an external location, especially when switching from one provider to one or several providers of destination, to relocate their data from one location to another while using the same cloud service provider. Therefore, in order to foster competition, the gradual withdrawal of the charges associated with switching data processing services should specifically include withdrawing egress fees charged by the data processing service to a customer.</span>

Those service delivery models represent a specific, pre-packaged combination of IT resources offered by a provider of data processing service. Three base cloud delivery models are further completed by emerging variations, each comprised of a distinct combination of IT resources, such as Storage-as-a-Service and Database-as-a-Service. For the purpose of this Regulation, data processing services can be categorised in more granular and a non-exhaustive multiplicity of different ‘equivalent services’, meaning sets of data processing services that share the same primary objective and main functionalities as well as the same type of data processing models, that are not related to the service operational characteristics. In an example two databases might appear to share the same primary objective, but after considering their data processing model, distribution model and targeted use-case, such databases should fall into a more granular subcategory of equivalent services. Equivalent services may have different and competing characteristics such as performance, security, resilience, and quality of service.</span>

In order to properly plan the exit strategy, avoid unnecessary and burdensome tasks and to ensure that the customer does not lose any of its data as a consequence of the switching process, the source provider of data processing services should include in the contract the mandatory information on the scope of the data that can be exported by the customer once he or she decides to switch to a different service, other provider of data processing services or move to on-premise ICT infrastructure. The scope of exportable data should include at a minimum input and output data, including relevant data formats, data structures and metadata directly or indirectly generated or co-generated by the customer’s use of the data processing service, and that can be clearly assigned to the customer. The exportable data should exclude any data processing service, or third party’s assets or data protected by intellectual property rights or constituting a trade secret or confidential information, such as data related to the integrity and security of the service provided by the data processing service, and should also exclude data used by the provider to operate, maintain and improve the service.</span>

                                       <span class="oj-italic">Switching is a customer-driven operation consisting in three main steps, namely (i) data extraction, i.e. downloading data from a source provider’s ecosystem; (ii) transformation, when the data is structured in a way that does not match the schema of the target location; and (iii) the uploading of the data in a new destination location. In a specific situation outlined in this Regulation, unbundling of a particular service from the contract and moving it to another provider should also be considered as switching. The switching process is sometimes managed on behalf of the customer by a third-party entity. Accordingly, all right and obligations of the customer established by this Regulation, including the obligation to collaborate in good faith, should be understood to apply to such a third-party entity in those circumstances. Providers of cloud computing services and customers have different levels of responsibilities, depending on the steps of the process referred to. For instance, the source provider of data processing services is responsible to extract the data to a machine-readable format, but it is the customer and the destination provider who will upload the data to the new environment, unless specific professional transition service has been obtained. Obstacles to switching are of a different nature, depending on which step of the switching process is referred to.</span>

Interoperability between equivalent data processing services involves multiple interfaces and layers of infrastructure and software and is rarely confined to a binary test of being achievable or not. Instead, the building of such interoperability is subject to a cost-benefit analysis which is necessary to establish whether it is worthwhile to pursue reasonably predictable results. The ISO/IEC 19941:2017 is an important reference for the achievement of the objectives of this Regulation, as it contains technical considerations clarifying the complexity of such a process.</span>

In the absence of international agreements regulating such matters, transfer or access should only be allowed if it has been verified that the third country’s legal system requires the reasons and proportionality of the decision to be set out, that the court order or the decision is specific in character, and that the reasoned objection of the addressee is subject to a review by a competent court in the third country, which is empowered to take duly into account the relevant legal interests of the provider of such data.

In order to help enterprises to draft and negotiate contracts, the Commission should develop and recommend non-mandatory model contractual terms for business-to-business data sharing contracts, where necessary taking into account the conditions in specific sectors and the existing practices with voluntary data sharing mechanisms. These model contractual terms should be primarily a practical tool to help in particular smaller enterprises to conclude a contract. When used widely and integrally, these model contractual terms should also have the beneficial effect of influencing the design of contracts about access to and use of data and therefore lead more broadly towards fairer contractual relations when accessing and sharing data.</p>
