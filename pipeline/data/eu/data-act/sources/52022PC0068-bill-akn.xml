          <p>In recent years, data-driven technologies have had transformative effects on all sectors of the economy. The proliferation in products connected to the Internet of Things in particular has increased the volume and potential value of data for consumers, businesses and society. High quality and interoperable data from different domains increase competitiveness and innovation and ensure sustainable economic growth. The same dataset may potentially be used and reused for a variety of purposes and to an unlimited degree, without any loss in its quality or quantity.</p>

          <p>Barriers to data sharing prevent an optimal allocation of data to the benefit of society. These barriers include a lack of incentives for data holders to enter voluntarily into data sharing agreements, uncertainty about rights and obligations in relation to data, costs of contracting and implementing technical interfaces, the high level of fragmentation of information in data silos, poor metadata management, the absence of standards for semantic and technical interoperability, bottlenecks impeding data access, a lack of common data sharing practices and abuse of contractual imbalances with regards to data access and use.</p>

          <p>In sectors characterised by the presence of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, there is often a lack of digital capacities and skills to collect, analyse and use data, and access is frequently restricted where one actor holds it in the system or due to a lack of interoperability between data, between data services or across borders.</p>

          <p>In order to respond to the needs of the digital economy and to remove barriers to a well-functioning internal market for data, it is necessary to lay down a harmonised framework specifying who, other than the manufacturer or other data holder is entitled to access the data generated by products or related services, under which conditions and on what basis. Accordingly, Member States should not adopt or maintain additional national requirements on those matters falling within the scope of this Regulation, unless explicitly provided for in this Regulation, since this would affect the direct and uniform application of this Regulation.</p>

          <p>This Regulation ensures that users of a product or related service in the Union can access, in a timely manner, the data generated by the use of that product or related service and that those users can use the data, including by sharing them with third parties of their choice. It imposes the obligation on the data holder to make data available to users and third parties nominated by the users in certain circumstances. It also ensures that data holders make data available to data recipients in the Union under fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and in a transparent manner. Private law rules are key in the overall framework of data sharing. Therefore, this Regulation adapts rules of contract law and prevents the exploitation of contractual imbalances that hinder fair data access and use for micro, small or medium-sized enterprises within the meaning of Recommendation 2003/361/EC. This Regulation also ensures that data holders make available to public sector bodies of the Member States and to Union institutions, agencies or bodies, where there is an exceptional need, the data that are necessary for the performance of tasks carried out in the public interest. In addition, this Regulation seeks to facilitate switching between data processing services and to enhance the interoperability of data and data sharing mechanisms and services in the Union. This Regulation should not be interpreted as recognising or creating any legal basis for the data holder to hold, have access to or process data, or as conferring any new right on the data holder to use data generated by the use of a product or related service. Instead, it takes as its starting point the control that the data holder effectively enjoys, de facto or de jure, over data generated by products or related services.</p>

          <p>Data generation is the result of the actions of at least two actors, the designer or manufacturer of a product and the user of that product. It gives rise to questions of fairness in the digital economy, because the data recorded by such products or related services are an important input for aftermarket, ancillary and other services. In order to realise the important economic benefits of data as a non-rival good for the economy and society, a general approach to assigning access and usage rights on data is preferable to awarding exclusive rights of access and use.</p>

          <p>The fundamental right to the protection of personal data is safeguarded in particular under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. Directive 2002/58/EC additionally protects private life and the confidentiality of communications, including providing conditions to any personal and non-personal data storing in and access from terminal equipment. These instruments provide the basis for sustainable and responsible data processing, including where datasets include a mix of personal and non-personal data. This Regulation complements and is without prejudice to Union law on data protection and privacy, in particular Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Directive 2002/58/EC. No provision of this Regulation should be applied or interpreted in such a way as to diminish or limit the right to the protection of personal data or the right to privacy and confidentiality of communications.</p>

          <p>The principles of data minimisation and data protection by design and by default are essential when processing involves significant risks to the fundamental rights of individuals. Taking into account the state of the art, all parties to data sharing, including where within scope of this Regulation, should implement technical and organisational measures to protect these rights. Such measures include not only pseudonymisation and encryption, but also the use of increasingly available technology that permits algorithms to be brought to the data and allow valuable insights to be derived without the transmission between parties or unnecessary copying of the raw or structured data themselves.</p>

          <p>It is necessary to lay down rules applying to connected products that incorporate or are interconnected with a service in such a way that the absence of the service would prevent the product from performing its functions. Such related services can be part of the sale, rent or lease agreement, or such services are normally provided for products of the same type and the user could reasonably expect them to be provided given the nature of the product and taking into account any public statement made by or on behalf of the seller, renter, lessor or other persons in previous links of the chain of transactions, including the manufacturer. These related services may themselves generate data of value to the user independently of the data collection capabilities of the product with which they are interconnected. This Regulation should also apply to a related service that is not supplied by the seller, renter or lessor itself, but is supplied, under the sales, rental or lease contract, by a third party. In the event of doubt as to whether the supply of service forms part of the sale, rent or lease contract, this Regulation should apply.</p>

          <p>In practice, not all data generated by products or related services are easily accessible to their users, and there are often limited possibilities for the portability of data generated by products connected to the Internet of Things. Users are unable to obtain data necessary to make use of providers of repair and other services, and businesses are unable to launch innovative, more efficient and convenient services. In many sectors, manufacturers are often able to determine, through their control of the technical design of the product or related services, what data are generated and how they can be accessed, even though they have no legal right to the data. It is therefore necessary to ensure that products are designed and manufactured and related services are provided in such a manner that data generated by their use are always easily accessible to the user.</p>

          <p>In case several persons or entities own a product or are party to a lease or rent agreement and benefit from access to a related service, reasonable efforts should be made in the design of the product or related service or the relevant interface so that all persons can have access to data they generate. Users of products that generate data typically require a user account to be set up. This allows for identification of the user by the manufacturer as well as a means to communicate to exercise and process data access requests. Manufacturers or designers of a product that is typically used by several persons should put in place the necessary mechanism that allow separate user accounts for individual persons, where relevant, or the possibility for several persons to use the same user account. Access should be granted to the user upon simple request mechanisms granting automatic execution, not requiring examination or clearance by the manufacturer or data holder. This means that data should only be made available when the user actually wants this. Where automated execution of the data access request is not possible, for instance, via a user account or accompanying mobile application provided with the product or service, the manufacturer should inform the user how the data may be accessed.</p>

          <p>Virtual assistants play an increasing role in digitising consumer environments and serve as an easy-to-use interface to play content, obtain information, or activate physical objects connected to the Internet of Things. Virtual assistants can act as a single gateway in, for example, a smart home environment and record significant amounts of relevant data on how users interact with products connected to the Internet of Things, including those manufactured by other parties and can replace the use of manufacturer-provided interfaces such as touchscreens or smart phone apps. The user may wish to make available such data with third party manufacturers and enable novel smart home services. Such virtual assistants should be covered by the data access right provided for in this Regulation also regarding data recorded before the virtual assistant’s activation by the wake word and data generated when a user interacts with a product via a virtual assistant provided by an entity other than the manufacturer of the product. However, only the data stemming from the interaction between the user and product through the virtual assistant falls within the scope of this Regulation. Data produced by the virtual assistant unrelated to the use of a product is not the object of this Regulation.</p>

          <p>Before concluding a contract for the purchase, rent, or lease of a product or the provision of a related service, clear and sufficient information should be provided to the user on how the data generated may be accessed. This obligation provides transparency over the data generated and enhances the easy access for the user. This obligation to provide information does not affect the obligation for the controller to provide information to the data subject pursuant to Article 12, 13 and 14 of Regulation 2016/679.</p>

          <p>This Regulation imposes the obligation on data holders to make data available in certain circumstances. Insofar as personal data are processed, the data holder should be a controller under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Where users are data subjects, data holders should be obliged to provide them access to their data and to make the data available to third parties of the user’s choice in accordance with this Regulation. However, this Regulation does not create a legal basis under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 for the data holder to provide access to personal data or make it available to a third party when requested by a user that is not a data subject and should not be understood as conferring any new right on the data holder to use data generated by the use of a product or related service. This applies in particular where the manufacturer is the data holder. In that case, the basis for the manufacturer to use non-personal data should be a contractual agreement between the manufacturer and the user. This agreement may be part of the sale, rent or lease agreement relating to the product. Any contractual term in the agreement stipulating that the data holder may use the data generated by the user of a product or related service should be transparent to the user, including as regards the purpose for which the data holder intends to use the data. This Regulation should not prevent contractual conditions, whose effect is to exclude or limit the use of the data, or certain categories thereof, by the data holder. This Regulation should also not prevent sector-specific regulatory requirements under Union law, or national law compatible with Union law, which would exclude or limit the use of certain such data by the data holder on well-defined public policy grounds.</p>

          <p>In sectors characterised by the concentration of a small number of manufacturers supplying end users, there are only limited options available to users with regard to sharing data with those manufacturers. In such circumstances, contractual agreements may be insufficient to achieve the objective of user empowerment. The data tends to remain under the control of the manufacturers, making it difficult for users to obtain value from the data generated by the equipment they purchase or lease. Consequently, there is limited potential for innovative smaller businesses to offer data-based solutions in a competitive manner and for a diverse data economy in Europe. This Regulation should therefore build on recent developments in specific sectors, such as the Code of Conduct on agricultural data sharing by contractual agreement. Sectoral legislation may be brought forward to address sector-specific needs and objectives. Furthermore, the data holder should not use any data generated by the use of the product or related service in order to derive insights about the economic situation of the user or its assets or production methods or the use in any other way that could undermine the commercial position of the user on the markets it is active on. This would, for instance, involve using knowledge about the overall performance of a business or a farm in contractual negotiations with the user on potential acquisition of the user’s products or agricultural produce to the user’s detriment, or for instance, using such information to feed in larger databases on certain markets in the aggregate (,e.g. databases on crop yields for the upcoming harvesting season) as such use could affect the user negatively in an indirect manner. The user should be given the necessary technical interface to manage permissions, preferably with granular permission options (such as “allow once” or “allow while using this app or service”), including the option to withdraw permission.</p>

          <p>The user should be free to use the data for any lawful purpose. This includes providing the data the user has received exercising the right under this Regulation to a third party offering an aftermarket service that may be in competition with a service provided by the data holder, or to instruct the data holder to do so. The data holder should ensure that the data made available to the third party is as accurate, complete, reliable, relevant and up-to-date as the data the data holder itself may be able or entitled to access from the use of the product or related service. Any trade secrets or intellectual property rights should be respected in handling the data. It is important to preserve incentives to invest in products with functionalities based on the use of data from sensors built into that product. The aim of this Regulation should accordingly be understood as to foster the development of new, innovative products or related services, stimulate innovation on aftermarkets, but also stimulate the development of entirely novel services making use of the data, including based on data from a variety of products or related services. At the same time, it aims to avoid undermining the investment incentives for the type of product from which the data are obtained, for instance, by the use of data to develop a competing product.</p>

          <p>The use of a product or related service may, in particular when the user is a natural person, generate data that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person (the data subject). Processing of such data is subject to the rules established under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, including where personal and non-personal data in a data set are inextricably linked
                  
               . The data subject may be the user or another natural person. Personal data may only be requested by a controller or a data subject. A user who is the data subject is under certain circumstances entitled under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 to access personal data concerning them, and such rights are unaffected by this Regulation. Under this Regulation, the user who is a natural person is further entitled to access all data generated by the product, personal and non-personal. Where the user is not the data subject but an enterprise, including a sole trader, and not in cases of shared household use of the product, the user will be a controller within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Accordingly, such a user as controller intending to request personal data generated by the use of a product or related service is required to have a legal basis for processing the data under Article 6(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, such as the consent of the data subject or legitimate interest. This user should ensure that the data subject is appropriately informed of the specified, explicit and legitimate purposes for processing those data, and how the data subject may effectively exercise their rights. Where the data holder and the user are joint controllers within the meaning of Article 26 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, they are required to determine, in a transparent manner by means of an arrangement between them, their respective responsibilities for compliance with that Regulation.  It should be understood that such a user, once data has been made available, may in turn become a data holder, if they meet the criteria under this Regulation and thus become subject to the obligations to make data available under this Regulation.</p>

          <p>Data generated by the use of a product or related service should only be made available to a third party at the request of the user. This Regulation accordingly complements the right provided under Article 20 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. That Article provides for a right of data subjects to receive personal data concerning them in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and to port those data to other controllers, where those data are processed on the basis of Article 6(1), point (a), or Article 9(2), point (a), or of a contract pursuant to Article 6(1), point (b). Data subjects also have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, but only where technically feasible. Article 20 specifies that it pertains to data provided by the data subject but does not specify whether this necessitates active behaviour on the side of the data subject or whether it also applies to situations where a product or related service by its design observes the behaviour of a data subject or other information in relation to a data subject in a passive manner. The right under this Regulation complements the right to receive and port personal data under Article 20 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in several ways. It grants users the right to access and make available to a third party to any data generated by the use of a product or related service, irrespective of its nature as personal data, of the distinction between actively provided or passively observed data, and irrespective of the legal basis of processing. Unlike the technical obligations provided for in Article 20 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, this Regulation mandates and ensures the technical feasibility of third party access for all types of data coming within its scope, whether personal or non-personal. It also allows the data holder to set reasonable compensation to be met by third parties, but not by the user, for any cost incurred in providing direct access to the data generated by the user’s product. If a data holder and third party are unable to agree terms for such direct access, the data subject should be in no way prevented from exercising the rights contained in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, including the right to data portability, by seeking remedies in accordance with that Regulation. It is to be understood in this context that, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679, a contractual agreement does not allow for the processing of special categories of personal data by the data holder or the third party.</p>

          <p>Access to any data stored in and accessed from terminal equipment is subject to Directive 2002/58/EC and requires the consent of the subscriber or user within the meaning of that Directive unless it is strictly necessary for the provision of an information society service explicitly requested by the user or subscriber (or for the sole purpose of the transmission of a communication). Directive 2002/58/EC (‘ePrivacy Directive’) (and the proposed ePrivacy Regulation) protect the integrity of the user's terminal equipment as regards the use of processing and storage capabilities and the collection of information.

          <p>In line with the data minimisation principle, the third party should only access additional information that is necessary for the provision of the service requested by the user. Having received access to data, the third party should process it exclusively for the purposes agreed with the user, without interference from the data holder. It should be as easy for the user to refuse or discontinue access by the third party to the data as it is for the user to authorise access. The third party should not coerce, deceive or manipulate the user in any way, by subverting or impairing the autonomy, decision-making or choices of the user, including by means of a digital interface with the user. in this context, third parties should not rely on so-called dark patterns in designing their digital interfaces. Dark patterns are design techniques that push or deceive consumers into decisions that have negative consequences for them. These manipulative techniques can be used to persuade users, particularly vulnerable consumers, to engage in unwanted behaviours, and to deceive users by nudging them into decisions on data disclosure transactions or to unreasonably bias the decision-making of the users of the service, in a way that subverts and impairs their autonomy, decision-making and choice. Common and legitimate commercial practices that are in compliance with Union law should not in themselves be regarded as constituting dark patterns. Third parties should comply with their obligations under relevant Union law, in particular the requirements set out in Directive 2005/29/EC, Directive 2011/83/EU, Directive 2000/31/EC and Directive 98/6/EC.</p>

          <p>The third party should also refrain from using the data to profile individuals unless these processing activities are strictly necessary to provide the service requested by the user. The requirement to delete data when no longer required for the purpose agreed with the user complements the right to erasure of the data subject pursuant to Article 17 of Regulation 2016/679. Where the third party is a provider of a data intermediation service within the meaning of [Data Governance Act], the safeguards for the data subject provided for by that Regulation apply. The third party may use the data to develop a new and innovative product or related service but not to develop a competing product.</p>

          <p>Start-ups, small and medium-sized enterprises and companies from traditional sectors with less-developed digital capabilities struggle to obtain access to relevant data. This Regulation aims to facilitate access to data for these entities, while ensuring that the corresponding obligations are scoped as proportionately as possible to avoid overreach. At the same time, a small number of very large companies have emerged with considerable economic power in the digital economy through the accumulation and aggregation of vast volumes of data and the technological infrastructure for monetising them. These companies include undertakings that provide core platform services controlling whole platform ecosystems in the digital economy and whom existing or new market operators are unable to challenge or contest. The [Regulation on contestable and fair markets in the digital sector (Digital Markets Act)] aims to redress these inefficiencies and imbalances by allowing the Commission to designate a provider as a “gatekeeper”, and imposes a number of obligations on such designated gatekeepers, including a prohibition to combine certain data without consent, and an obligation to ensure effective rights to data portability under Article 20 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Consistent with the [Regulation on contestable and fair markets in the digital sector (Digital Markets Act)], and given the unrivalled ability of these companies to acquire data, it would not be necessary to achieve the objective of this Regulation, and would thus be disproportionate in relation to data holders made subject to such obligations, to include such gatekeeper undertakings as beneficiaries of the data access right. This means that an undertaking providing core platform services that has been designated as a gatekeeper cannot request or be granted access to users’ data generated by the use of a product or related service or by a virtual assistant based on the provisions of Chapter II of this Regulation. An undertaking providing core platform services designated as a gatekeeper pursuant to Digital Markets Act should be understood to include all legal entities of a group of companies where one legal entity provides a core platform service. Furthermore, third parties to whom data are made available at the request of the user may not make the data available to a designated gatekeeper. For instance, the third party may not sub-contract the service provision to a gatekeeper. However, this does not prevent third parties from using data processing services offered by a designated gatekeeper. This exclusion of designated gatekeepers from the scope of the access right under this Regulation does not prevent these companies from obtaining data through other lawful means.</p>

          <p>Given the current state of technology, it is overly burdensome to impose further design obligations in relation to products manufactured or designed and related services provided by micro and small enterprises. That is not the case, however, where a micro or small enterprise is sub-contracted to manufacture or design a product. In such situations, the enterprise, which has sub-contracted to the micro or small enterprise, is able to compensate the sub-contractor appropriately. A micro or small enterprise may nevertheless be subject to the requirements laid down by this Regulation as data holder, where it is not the manufacturer of the product or a provider of related services.</p>

          <p>Where one party is in a stronger bargaining position, there is a risk that that party could leverage such position to the detriment of the other contracting party when negotiating access to data and make access to data commercially less viable and sometimes economically prohibitive. Such contractual imbalances particularly harm micro, small and medium-sized enterprises without a meaningful ability to negotiate the conditions for access to data, who may have no other choice than to accept ‘take-it-or-leave-it’ contractual terms. Therefore, unfair contract terms regulating the access to and use of data or the liability and remedies for the breach or the termination of data related obligations should not be binding on micro, small or medium-sized enterprises when they have been unilaterally imposed on them.</p>

Therefore, not all contractual terms should be subject to an unfairness test, but only to those terms that are unilaterally imposed on micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. This concerns ‘take-it-or-leave-it’ situations where one party supplies a certain contractual term and the micro, small or medium-sized enterprise cannot influence the content of that term despite an attempt to negotiate it. A contractual term that is simply provided by one party and accepted by the micro, small or medium-sized enterprise or a term that is negotiated and subsequently agreed in an amended way between contracting parties should not be considered as unilaterally imposed.</p>

Public emergencies are rare events and not all such emergencies require the use of data held by enterprises. The business activities of the data holders are therefore not likely to be negatively affected as a consequence of the public sector bodies or Union institutions, agencies or bodies having recourse to this Regulation. However, as cases of an exceptional need other than responding to a public emergency might be more frequent, including cases of prevention of or recovery from a public emergency, data holders should in such cases be entitled to a reasonable compensation which should not exceed the technical and organisational costs incurred in complying with the request and the reasonable margin required for making the data available to the public sector body or to the Union institution, agency or body. The compensation should not be understood as constituting payment for the data itself and as being compulsory.</p>

Such data may also be shared under the same circumstances with the national statistical institutes and Eurostat for the compilation of official statistics. Such research activities should however be compatible with the purpose for which the data was requested and the data holder should be informed about the further sharing of the data it had provided. Individuals conducting research or research organisations with whom these data may be shared should act either on a not-for-profit basis or in the context of a public-interest mission recognised by the State.

          <p>Regulation (EU) 2018/1807 of the European Parliament and of the Council encourages service providers to effectively develop and implement self-regulatory codes of conduct covering best practices for, inter alia, facilitating the switching of data processing service providers and the porting of data. Given the limited efficacy of the self-regulatory frameworks developed in response, and the general unavailability of open standards and interfaces, it is necessary to adopt a set of minimum regulatory obligations on providers of data processing services to eliminate contractual, economic and technical barriers to effective switching between data processing services.</p>

          <p>Data processing services should cover services that allow on-demand and broad remote access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable and distributed computing resources. Those computing resources include resources such as networks, servers or other virtual or physical infrastructure, operating systems, software, including software development tools, storage, applications and services. The capability of the customer of the data processing service to unilaterally self-provision computing capabilities, such as server time or network storage, without any human interaction by the service provider could be described as on-demand administration. The term ‘broad remote access’ is used to describe that the computing capabilities are provided over the network and accessed through mechanisms promoting the use of heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (from web browsers to mobile devices and workstations). The term ‘scalable’ refers to computing resources that are flexibly allocated by the data processing service provider, irrespective of the geographical location of the resources, in order to handle fluctuations in demand. The term ‘elastic pool’ is used to describe those computing resources that are provisioned and released according to demand in order to rapidly increase or decrease resources available depending on workload. The term ‘shareable’ is used to describe those computing resources that are provided to multiple users who share a common access to the service, but where the processing is carried out separately for each user, although the service is provided from the same electronic equipment. The term ‘distributed’ is used to describe those computing resources that are located on different networked computers or devices and which communicate and coordinate among themselves by message passing. The term ‘highly distributed’ is used to describe data processing services that involve data processing closer to where data are being generated or collected, for instance in a connected data processing device. Edge computing, which is a form of such highly distributed data processing, is expected to generate new business models and cloud service delivery models, which should be open and interoperable from the outset.</p>

          <p>This Regulation aims to facilitate switching between data processing services, which encompasses all conditions and actions that are necessary for a customer to terminate a contractual agreement of a data processing service, to conclude one or multiple new contracts with different providers of data processing services, to port all its digital assets, including data, to the concerned other providers and to continue to use them in the new environment while benefitting from functional equivalence. Digital assets refer to elements in digital format for which the customer has the right of use, including data, applications, virtual machines and other manifestations of virtualisation technologies, such as containers. Functional equivalence means the maintenance of a minimum level of functionality of a service after switching, and should be deemed technically feasible whenever both the originating and the destination data processing services cover (in part or in whole) the same service type. Meta-data, generated by the customer’s use of a service, should also be portable pursuant to this Regulation’s provisions on switching.</p>

Nevertheless, service providers are required to offer all assistance and support that is required to make the switching process effective. Existing rights relating to the termination of contracts, including those introduced by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Directive (EU) 2019/770 of the European Parliament and of the Council

          <p>To facilitate switching between data processing services, providers of data processing services should consider the use of implementation and/or compliance tools, notably those published by the Commission in the form of a Rulebook relating to cloud services. In particular, standard contractual clauses are beneficial to increase confidence in data processing services, to create a more balanced relationship between users and service providers and to improve legal certainty on the conditions that apply for switching to other data processing services. In this light, users and service providers should consider the use of standard contractual clauses developed by relevant bodies or expert groups established under Union law.</p>

          <p>Open interoperability specifications and standards developed in accordance with paragraph 3 and 4 of Annex II of Regulation (EU) 1025/2021 in the field of interoperability and portability enable a seamless multi-vendor cloud environment, which is a key requirement for open innovation in the European data economy. As market-driven processes have not demonstrated the capacity to establish technical specifications or standards that facilitate effective cloud interoperability at the PaaS (platform-as-a-service) and SaaS (software-as-a-service) levels, the Commission should be able, on the basis of this Regulation and in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, to request European standardisation bodies to develop such standards, particularly for service types where such standards do not yet exist. In addition to this, the Commission will encourage parties in the market to develop relevant open interoperability specifications. The Commission, by way of delegated acts, can mandate the use of European standards for interoperability or open interoperability specifications for specific service types through a reference in a central Union standards repository for the interoperability of data processing services. European standards and open interoperability specifications will only be referenced if in compliance with the criteria specified in this Regulation, which have the same meaning as the requirements in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Annex II of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2021 and the interoperability facets defined under the ISO/IEC 19941:2017.</p>

          <p>Third countries may adopt laws, regulations and other legal acts that aim at directly transferring or providing governmental access to non-personal data located outside their borders, including in the Union. Judgments of courts or tribunals or decisions of other judicial or administrative authorities, including law enforcement authorities in third countries requiring such transfer or access to non-personal data should be enforceable when based on an international agreement, such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, in force between the requesting third country and the Union or a Member State. In other cases, situations may arise where a request to transfer or provide access to non-personal data arising from a third country law conflicts with an obligation to protect such data under Union law or national law, in particular as regards the protection of fundamental rights of the individual, such as the right to security and the right to effective remedy, or the fundamental interests of a Member State related to national security or defence, as well as the protection of commercially sensitive data, including the protection of trade secrets, and the protection of intellectual property rights, and including its contractual undertakings regarding confidentiality in accordance with such law. In the absence of international agreements regulating such matters, transfer or access should only be allowed if it has been verified that the third country’s legal system requires the reasons and proportionality of the decision to be set out, that the court order or the decision is specific in character, and that the reasoned objection of the addressee is subject to a review by a competent court in the third country, which is empowered to take duly into account the relevant legal interests of the provider of such data. Wherever possible under the terms of the data access request of the third country’s authority, the provider of data processing services should be able to inform the customer whose data are being requested in order to verify the presence of a potential conflict of such access with Union or national rules, such as those on the protection of commercially sensitive data, including the protection of trade secrets and intellectual property rights and the contractual undertakings regarding confidentiality.</p>

In order to facilitate the conformity with the requirements for interoperability, it is necessary to provide for a presumption of conformity for interoperability solutions that meet harmonised standards or parts thereof in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The Commission should adopt common specifications in areas where no harmonised standards exist or where they are insufficient in order to further enhance interoperability for the common European data spaces, application programming interfaces, cloud switching as well as smart contracts. Additionally, common specifications in the different sectors could remain to be adopted, in accordance with Union or national sectoral law, based on the specific needs of those sectors. Reusable data structures and models (in form of core vocabularies), ontologies, metadata application profile, reference data in the form of core vocabulary, taxonomies, code lists, authority tables, thesauri should also be part of the technical specifications for semantic interoperability.

They should take into account whether the infringer systematically or recurrently fails to comply with its obligations stemming from this Regulation. In order to help enterprises to draft and negotiate contracts, the Commission should develop and recommend non-mandatory model contractual terms for business-to-business data sharing contracts, where necessary taking into account the conditions in specific sectors and the existing practices with voluntary data sharing mechanisms. These model contractual terms should be primarily a practical tool to help in particular smaller enterprises to conclude a contract. When used widely and integrally, these model contractual terms should also have the beneficial effect of influencing the design of contracts about access to and use of data and therefore lead more broadly towards fairer contractual relations when accessing and sharing data.</p>
