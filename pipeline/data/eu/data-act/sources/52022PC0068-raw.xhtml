            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>This explanatory memorandum accompanies the proposal for a Regulation on harmonised rules on fair access to and use of data (Data Act). </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Data is a core component of the digital economy, and an essential resource to secure the green and digital transitions. The volume of data generated by humans and machines has been increasing exponentially in recent years. Most data are unused however, or its value is concentrated in the hands of relatively few large companies. Low trust, conflicting economic incentives and technological obstacles impede the full realisation of the potential of data-driven innovation. It is therefore crucial to unlock such potential by providing opportunities for the reuse of data, as well as by removing barriers to the development of the European data economy in compliance with European rules and fully respecting European values, and in line with the mission to reduce the digital divide so that everyone benefits from these opportunities. Ensuring greater balance in the distribution of the value from data in step with the new wave of non-personal industrial data and the proliferation of products connected to the Internet of Things means there is enormous potential for boosting a sustainable data economy in Europe. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Regulating data access and use is </span><span>a </span><span>fundamental </span><span>prerequisite for seizing</span><span> the opportunities </span><span>presented by </span><span>the</span><span> digital age</span><span> we live in</span><span>. The President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, </span><span>stated </span><span>in </span><span>her </span><span>political guidelines for the 2019-2024 Commission that Europe must ‘</span><span>balance the flow and use of data while preserving high privacy, security, safety and ethical standards</span><span>’</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref1" href="#footnote1">1</a>

               </span><span> </span><span>set out </span><span>several strategic objectives, including the European </span><span>s</span><span>trategy for </span><span>d</span><span>ata</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">3</a>
               </span><span>, adopted in February 2020. Th</span><span>at</span><span> strategy aims at building a genuine single market for data and at making Europe a global leader in the data-agile economy. For this reason, the Data Act is a key pillar and the second major initiative announced in the data strategy. </span><span>In particular, it</span><span> contributes to the creation of a cross-sectoral governance framework for data access and use by legislating on matters that affect relations between data economy actors, in order to provide incentives for horizontal data sharing across sectors.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The European Council’s Conclusions of 21-22 October 2021 underlined ‘</span><span>the importance of making rapid progress on existing and future initiatives, in particular unlocking the value of data in Europe, notably through a comprehensive regulatory framework that is conducive to innovation and facilitates better data portability, fair access to data and ensures interoperability</span><span>’</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">4</a>
               </span><span>. </span><span>On 25 March 2021, the European Council reiterated ‘</span><span>the importance of better exploiting the potential of data and digital technologies for the benefit of the society and economy</span><span>’</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a>
               </span><span>. On 1-2 October 2020, it stressed ‘</span><span>the need to make high-quality data more readily available and to promote and enable better sharing and pooling of data, as well as interoperability</span><span>’</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a>
               </span><span>. On cloud services, on 15 October 2020, the EU </span><span>Member States</span><span> </span><span>unanimously adopted a Joint Declaration on building the next generation cloud for businesses and the public sector in the EU. This would require a next generation of EU cloud offering that reaches the highest standards in in portability and interoperability, for example</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a>
               </span><span>. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The European Parliament resolution of 25 March 2021 on a European strategy for data urged the Commission to present a data act to encourage and enable greater and fair</span><span>er</span><span> </span><span>flow of data in all sectors, from</span><span> business-to-business, business-to-government, government-to-business and government-to-government</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">8</a>
               </span><span>. </span><span>In its resolution of 25 March 2021, the</span><span> European Parliament </span><span>also</span><span> highlighted the need </span><span>to create common European data spaces </span><span>for</span><span> the free flow of non-personal data across borders and sectors </span><span>and </span><span>between businesses, academia, relevant stakeholders and the public sector</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>From this perspective, </span><span>it encouraged the Commission to clarify utilisation rights, especially in business-to-business and business-to-government settings. It stressed that market imbalances arising from the concentration of data restrict competition</span><span>,</span><span> increase market entry barriers and diminish wider data access and use. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In its resolution, the European Parliament also pointed out that business-to-business contractual agreements do not necessarily guarantee adequate access to data for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The reason for this is that there are disparities in negotiation power and expertise. The European Parliament therefore stressed the need for contracts to set out clear obligations and determine liability for accessing, processing, sharing and storing data in order to limit its misuse. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>As such, the Commission and EU Member States were asked to examine actors’ rights and their obligations to access data they have been involved in generating and to improve their awareness of, in particular, the right to access data, to port it, to urge another party to stop using it, or to rectify or delete it, while also identifying the holders and delineating the nature of such rights. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>On the business-to-government front, the European Parliament requested that the Commission set out the situations, conditions and incentives under which the private sector should be obliged to make data available for use by the public sector, such as due to its necessity for the organisation of data-driven public services, and also examine compulsory business-to-government data sharing schemes, for instance in situations that are beyond people’s control.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In this context, the Commission puts forward the proposed </span><span>Data Act </span><span>with the</span><span> aim of ensuring fairness in the allocation of value from data among actors in the data economy and to foster access to and use of data</span><span>. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The proposal will help achieve the broader policy goals of ensuring EU businesses across all sectors are in a position to innovate and compete, effectively empowering individuals with respect to their data, and better equipping businesses and public sector bodies with a proportionate and predictable mechanism to tackle major policy and societal challenges, including public emergencies and other exceptional situations. Businesses will be able to easily switch their data and other digital assets between competing providers of cloud and other data processing services. Data sharing within and between sectors of the economy requires an interoperability framework of procedural and legislative measures to enhance trust and improve efficiency. The creation of common European data spaces for strategic sectors of the economy and domains of public interest will contribute to a genuine internal market for data enabling data sharing and use across sectors. This Regulation therefore contributes to these governance frameworks and infrastructure as well as data sharing outside data spaces. </span>

               <span>The legal basis for this proposal is Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, whose objective is the establishment and functioning of the internal market by enhancing measures for the approximation of national rules.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Text1">
               <span>This proposal intends to further the completion of the internal market for data in which data from the public sector, businesses and individuals is put to the best possible use, while respecting rights in relation to such data and the investments made in order to collect it. The provisions on switching between data processing services aim to establish fair and competitive market conditions for the internal market in cloud, edge and related services.</span>

            <p class="Text1">
               <span>The protection of confidential business data and trade secrets is an important aspect of the well-functioning of the internal market, as is the case for other contexts in which services are exchanged and goods are traded. This proposal ensures respect for trade secrets in the context of data use between businesses or by consumers. The initiative will allow the Union to benefit from the scale of the internal market, since products or related services are often developed using data from different Member States, and later commercialised across the Union.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Text1">
               <span>Some Member States have taken legislative action to address the problems described above, in business-to-business and business-to-government scenarios, whereas others have not. This can lead to legislative fragmentation in the internal market and different rules and practices across the Union and related costs by companies that would have to comply with different regimes. It is therefore important to ensure that the proposed measures are applied consistently across Member States.</span>

            <p class="Text1">
               <span>Given the cross-border nature of the use of data and the many areas of impact of the Data Act, the issues this proposal deals with cannot be effectively addressed at Member State level. Fragmentation arising out of differences between national rules should be avoided, as it would lead to higher transactional costs, lack of transparency, legal uncertainty and undesirable forum shopping. Avoiding this is particularly important in all situations concerning the data aspects of business-to-business relations, including fair contractual terms and the obligations of manufacturers of Internet of Things products or related services, aspects that require homogeneity of the framework throughout the Union. </span>

            <p class="Text1">
               <span>An assessment of the cross-border aspects of data flows in the area of business-to-government data sharing also demonstrates the need to act at Union level. Many private actors who hold relevant data are multinational companies. These companies should not be confronted with a fragmented legal regime. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Text1">
               <span>Cloud computing services are rarely offered in one Member State only. In line with the GDPR and the Free Flow of Non-Personal Data Regulation that enable consumers and businesses to process personal and non-personal data anywhere they want in the Union, the cross-border processing of data within the Union is essential for conducting business in the internal market. It is therefore crucial that provisions on switching data processing services are applied at Union level, to avoid harmful fragmentation in an otherwise unified market for data processing services.</span>

It creates an enabling framework that does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives. It addresses existing barriers to fuller realisation of the potential value of data among businesses, consumers and the public sector. It also sets out a framework for future sectoral rules to avoid fragmentation and legal uncertainty. It clarifies existing rights and, where necessary, provides access rights to data, thereby helping to develop an internal market for data sharing.

A regulation is necessary in light of the goal of comprehensive harmonisation pursued by the proposal, in order to ensure legal certainty and transparency for economic operators, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and to provide legal and natural persons in all Member States with the same level of legally enforceable rights and obligations, to ensure consistent enforcement in all Member States, as well as effective cooperation between the competent authorities of different Member States.</span>

               <span>In total, 449 contributions were received from 32 countries. Business entities constituted the largest number of contributions, comprising 122 business associations and 105 companies/business organisations. In addition, 100 respondents were public authorities and 58 were individual members of the public. Generally, the responses confirmed that there is a whole host of obstacles to effective and efficient data sharing in all types of data relations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In the business-to-business context, despite data sharing between businesses being a common practice, respondents who had experienced difficulties identified obstacles such as those of a technical nature (formats, lack of standards – 69%); outright refusal to grant access not linked to competition concerns (55%) or the abuse of a contractual imbalance (44%). On contractual issues, almost half of respondents were in favour of introducing an unfairness test (46%), while more than double of those were not in favour (21%). SMEs showed strong support (50%) for an unfairness test, and a significant number of large companies were also in favour (41%) of it. Similarly, 46% of stakeholders across sectors showed support for general access rules based on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms (46%). 60% of respondents, SMEs and micro companies in particular (78%), agreed that model contractual terms could contribute to increased data sharing. 70% of stakeholders expressed the opinion that there is a fairness problem with data generated in the Internet of Things context, and that manufacturers of connected products or related services should not be able to decide unilaterally on what happens to the data generated by such products. 79% of respondents considered that smart contracts could be an effective tool to technically implement data access and use in the context of co-generated Internet of Things data.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Legal uncertainty and barriers, commercial disincentives, and a lack of appropriate infrastructure were amongst the main factors impeding business-to-government data sharing identified by respondents. Almost all public authorities consider that action (Union or Member State) on business-to-government data sharing is needed, compared to 80% of academic/ research institutions and 38% of companies/ business organisations/ associations. A clear majority of stakeholders (in particular citizens and public administrations) also expressed the opinion that business-to-government data sharing should be compulsory, with clear safeguards for specific use-cases with a clear public interest in emergencies and for crisis management purposes, for official statistics, for environmental protection and for a healthier society in general.</span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Respondents also confirmed the usefulness of a right to switchability for business users of cloud computing services. As regards safeguards for non-personal data in international contexts, 76% of respondents perceive potential access to data by foreign authorities on the basis of foreign legislation as a risk to their organisation, with 19% indicating that it is a major risk. </span>

               <span>In Chapter II, a high level of consumer protection is reinforced with the new right to access user generated data in situations previously not covered by Union law. The right to use and dispose of lawfully acquired possessions is reinforced with a right to access data generated from the use of an Internet of Things object. This way, the owner may benefit from a better user experience and a wider range of, for example, repair and maintenance services. In the context of consumer protection, the rights of children as vulnerable consumers deserve specific attention and the rules of the Data Act will contribute to clarity about data access and use situations. </span>

            <p class="Text1">
               <span>The Internet of Things data access right for third parties upon the user’s request limits the freedom to conduct a business and the freedom of contract of the manufacturer or designer of a product or related service. The limitation is justified in order to enhance consumer protection, in particular to promote consumer’s economic interests. The manufacturer or designer of a product or related service typically has exclusive control over the use of data generated by the use of a product or related service, which contributes to lock-in effects and hinders market entry for players offering aftermarket services. The Internet of Things data access right addresses this situation by further empowering consumers using products or related services to meaningfully control how the data generated by their use of the product or related service is used and enabling innovation by more market players. Consumers can therefore benefit from a wider choice in aftermarket services, such as repair and maintenance, and no longer depend on only the manufacturer’s services. The proposal facilitates the portability of the user’s data to third parties and thereby allows for a competitive offer of aftermarket services, as well as broader data-based innovation and the development of products or services unrelated to those initially purchased or subscribed to by the user.</span>

               <span>The limitation of the manufacturer’s or designer’s freedom to contract and conduct a business is proportionate and mitigated by the unaffected ability of the manufacturer or designer to also use the data, insofar it is in line with the applicable legislation and the agreement with the user. Furthermore, the manufacturer or designer will also benefit from the right to require compensation for enabling third party access. The access right is without prejudice to the existing access and portability rights for data subjects under the GDPR. Additional safeguards ensure a proportionate use of the data by the third party.</span>

               <span>Chapter II increases legal certainty for consumers and businesses to access data generated by the products or related services they own, rent or lease. Manufacturers and designers have to design the products in a way that makes the data easily accessible by default, and they will have to be transparent on what data will be accessible and how to access them. Provisions in this Chapter shall not affect the possibility for manufacturers to access and use data from products or related services they offer, where agreed with the user.

Where a data holder is obliged to make data available to a data recipient as in Chapter II or in other Union law or Member State legislation, the general framework addresses the conditions under which data is made available and the compensation for making data available. Any conditions will have to be fair and non-discriminatory, and any compensation will have to be reasonable, without precluding other Union law or national legislation implementing Union law from excluding compensation or providing for lower compensation for making data available. Any compensation set for SMEs cannot exceed the costs incurred for making the data available, unless otherwise specified in sectoral legislations. Dispute settlement bodies certified by the Member States may assist parties that disagree on the compensation or conditions to come to an agreement. </span>

               <span>Chapter V creates a harmonised framework for the use by public sector bodies and Union institutions, agencies and bodies of data held by enterprises in situations where there is an exceptional need for the data requested. The framework is based on an obligation to make data available and would only apply in the case of public emergencies or in situations where public sector bodies have an exceptional need to use certain data, but such data cannot be obtained on the market, in a timely manner through enacting new legislation, or by means of existing reporting obligations. In case of an exceptional need to respond to public emergency, such as public health emergencies, or major natural or human-induced disasters, data would be made available for free. In other cases of exceptional need, including to prevent or assist the recovery from a public emergency, the data holder making the data available should be entitled to compensation that include costs related to making the relevant data available plus a reasonable margin. To ensure that the right to request data is not abused and that the public sector remains accountable for its use, the requests for data would need to be proportionate, clearly indicate the purpose to be achieved, and respect the interests of the enterprise making the data available. Competent authorities would ensure the transparency and public availability of all requests. They would also handle any resulting complaints.</span>

               <span>Chapter VI introduces minimum regulatory requirements of contractual, commercial and technical nature, imposed on providers of cloud, edge and other data processing services, to enable switching between such services. In particular, the proposal ensures that customers maintain functional equivalence (a minimum level of functionality) of the service after they have switched to another service provider. The proposal contains an exception for technical unfeasibility, but puts the burden of proof in this regard on the service provider. The proposal does not mandate specific technical standards or interfaces. However, it requires services to be compatible with European standards or open interoperability technical specifications where these exist.</span>

               <span>Chapter VII addresses unlawful third party access to non-personal data held in the Union by data processing services offered on the Union market. The proposal does not affect the legal basis of data access requests made to data held by EU citizens or businesses and is without prejudice to the Union’s data protection and privacy framework. It offers specific safeguards, by way of providers having to take all reasonable technical, legal and organisational measures to prevent such access that conflicts with competing obligations to protect such data under Union law, unless strict conditions are met. The Regulation complies with the Union’s international commitments in the WTO and in bilateral trade agreements.</span>
