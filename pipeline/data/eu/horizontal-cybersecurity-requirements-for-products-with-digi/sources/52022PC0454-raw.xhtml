               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>Hardware and software products are increasingly subject to successful cyberattacks, leading to an estimated global annual cost of cybercrime of EUR 5.5 trillion by 2021. Such products suffer from two major problems adding costs for users and the society: (1) a low level of cybersecurity, reflected by widespread vulnerabilities and the insufficient and inconsistent provision of security updates to address them, and (2) an insufficient understanding and access to information by users, preventing them from choosing products with adequate cybersecurity properties or using them in a secure manner. In a connected environment, a cybersecurity incident in one product can affect an entire organisation or a whole supply chain, often propagating across the borders of the internal market within a matter of minutes. This can lead to severe disruption of economic and social activities or even become life threatening.</span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The cybersecurity of products with digital elements has a strong cross-border dimension, as products manufactured in one country are often used across the internal market. In addition, incidents initially affecting a single entity or a single Member State often spread within minutes across the entire internal market.</span>
               </p>
            </div>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>While existing internal market legislation applies to certain products with digital elements, most of the hardware and software products are currently not covered by any EU legislation tackling their cybersecurity. In particular, the current EU legal framework does not address the cybersecurity of non-embedded software, even if cybersecurity attacks increasingly target vulnerabilities in these products, causing significant societal and economic costs. There are numerous examples of noteworthy cyberattacks resulting from suboptimal product security, such as the WannaCry ransomware worm, which exploited a Windows vulnerability that affected 200 000 computers across 150 countries in 2017 and caused a damage amounting to billions of USD; the Kaseya VSA supply chain attack, which used Kaseya’s network administration software to attack over 1 000 companies and forcing a supermarket chain to close all its 500 shops across Sweden; or the many incidents in which banking applications are hacked to steal money from unsuspecting consumers.</span>
            </p>
            <div class="border">
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>Two main objectives were identified aiming to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market: (1) create conditions for the development of secure products with digital elements by ensuring that hardware and software products are placed on the market with fewer vulnerabilities and ensure that manufacturers take security seriously throughout a product’s life cycle; and (2) create conditions allowing users to take cybersecurity into account when selecting and using products with digital elements. Four specific objectives were set out: (i) ensure that manufacturers improve the security of products with digital elements since the design and development phase and throughout the whole life cycle; (ii) ensure a coherent cybersecurity framework, facilitating compliance for hardware and software producers; (iii) enhance the transparency of security properties of products with digital elements, and (iv) enable businesses and consumers to use products with digital elements securely.</span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The strong cross-border nature of cybersecurity and the growing incidents, with spill-over effects across borders, sectors and products, mean that the objectives cannot effectively be achieved by Member States alone. Given the global nature of markets for products with digital elements, Member States face the same risks for the same product with digital elements on their territory. An emerging fragmented framework of potentially diverging national rules risks hampering an open and competitive single market for products with digital elements. Joint action at EU level is thus necessary to increase the level of trust among users and the attractiveness of EU products with digital elements. It would also benefit the internal market by providing legal certainty and achieving a level playing field for vendors of products with digital elements, as highlighted also in the final report of the Conference on the Future of Europe, in which citizens call for a stronger role for the EU in countering cybersecurity threats.</span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Cybersecurity of the entire supply chain is ensured only if all its components are cyber-secure. The above-mentioned EU legislation has however substantial gaps in this regard, as it does not cover mandatory requirements for the security of products with digital elements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>While the proposed Cyber Resilience Act covers products with digital elements placed on the market, the Directive [Directive XXX/XXX (NIS2)] aims at ensuring a high level of cybersecurity of services provided by essential and important entities. Directive [Directive XXX/XXXX (NIS2)] requires Member States to ensure that essential and important entities within the scope, such as health care or cloud providers and public administration entities, take appropriate and proportionate technical, operational and organisational cybersecurity measures. This includes, among others, a requirement to ensure security in network and information systems acquisition, development and maintenance, including vulnerability handling and disclosure. Directive [Directive XXX/XXXX (NIS2)] requires the Commission to adopt implementing acts laying down the technical and the methodological requirements of those measures within 21 months after the date of entry into force of this Directive for certain types of entities, such as cloud computing service providers. For all other entities, the Commission may adopt an implementing act, laying down the technical and the methodological requirements, as well as sectoral requirements. This framework will ensure that technical specifications and measures similar to the essential cybersecurity requirements of the Cyber Resilience Act are also implemented for the design, development and vulnerability handling of software provided as a service (Software-as-a-Service). For example, this could be a means to ensure a high level of cybersecurity in cases such as electronic health records (EHR) systems, including when delivered as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) or developed within health institutions (in-house), in accordance with the proposed [European Health Data Space Regulation].</span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The various acts and initiatives taken so far at EU and national levels only partially address the problems identified and risk creating a legislative patchwork within the internal market, increasing legal uncertainty for both vendors and users of these products and adding unnecessary burden on companies to comply with a number of requirements for similar types of products.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The proposed Regulation would harmonise and streamline the EU regulatory landscape by introducing cybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements and avoid overlapping requirements stemming from different pieces of legislation. This would create greater legal certainty for operators and users across the Union, as well as a better harmonisation of the European single market, creating more viable conditions for operators aiming at entering the EU market.</span>

               <span>The strong cross-border nature of cybersecurity in general and the growing number of risks and incidents, which have spill-over effects across borders, sectors and products, mean that the objectives of the present intervention cannot effectively be achieved by Member States alone. National approaches in addressing the problems, and in particular approaches introducing mandatory requirements, will create additional legal uncertainty and legal barriers.

               <span>As regards the proportionality of the proposed Regulation, the measures in the policy options considered would not go beyond what is needed to achieve the general and specific objectives and would not impose disproportionate costs. More specifically, the intervention considered would ensure that products with digital elements would be secured throughout their whole life cycle and proportionally to the risks faced through objective-oriented and technology neutral requirements that remain reasonable and generally corresponding to the interest of the entities involved. </span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The essential cybersecurity requirements in the proposal are building on widely used standards, and the standardisation process that will follow would take into account the technical specificities of the products. This means that where needed for a given risk level, security controls would be adapted. Furthermore, the envisaged horizontal rules would only foresee third-party assessment for critical products. This would only include a narrow share of the market for products with digital elements. The impact on SMEs would depend on their presence in the market of these specific product categories. </span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Regarding the proportionality of the costs for conformity assessment, notified bodies conducting the third party assessments would take the size of the undertaking into account when setting their fees. A reasonable transition period of 24 months to prepare the implementation would also be provided , giving time to the relevant markets to prepare, while providing a clear direction for R&amp;D investments. Any compliance costs for businesses would be outweighed by the benefits brought by a higher level of security of products with digital elements and ultimately an increase of trust of users in these products.</span>

                  <span>A regulatory intervention would entail the adoption of a regulation and not a directive. This is because, for this particular type of product legislation, a regulation would more effectively address the problems identified and meet the objectives formulated, since it is an intervention that is conditioning the placing on the internal market of a very wide category of products. The transposition process in the case of a directive for such intervention could leave too much room for discretion at national level, potentially leading to lack of uniformity of certain essential cybersecurity requirements, legal uncertainty, further fragmentation or even discriminatory situations cross-border, even more taking account of the fact that the products covered could be of multiple purpose or use and that manufacturers can produce multiple categories of such products.</span>

Given the global nature of product with digital elements markets, Member States face the same risks for the same product with digital elements on their territory. An emerging patchy framework of potentially diverging national rules also risks hampering an open and competitive single market for products with digital elements. Joint action at EU level is thus necessary to increase the level of trust among users and the attractiveness of EU products with digital elements.

These action areas may require specific profiles or new assignments, but these would not be notable and can be absorbed by the existing resources of ENISA and resolved through reallocation or linking of various assignments. For example, one of the main action areas assigned to ENISA concerns the gathering and processing of notifications from manufacturers on exploited product vulnerabilities. [Directive XXX/ XXXX (NIS2)] has already tasked ENISA to establish a European vulnerability database where publicly known vulnerabilities can be disclosed and registered, on a voluntary basis, for the purpose of allowing users to take appropriate mitigating measures. Resources allocated for that purpose could also be used for the new above-mentioned assignments relating to notifications of product vulnerabilities. That could ensure an effective use of existing resources and would also create the necessary synergies between such assignments that can better inform ENISA’s analyses of cybersecurity risks and threats.</span>

                  <span>This Regulation assigns certain actions to ENISA, in line with its existing mandate, and in particular Art 3(2) of Regulation 2019/881 establishing that ENISA should carry out the tasks assigned to it by Union legal acts that set out measures for approximating Member State laws, regulations and administrative provisions which are related to cybersecurity. In particular, ENISA is tasked to receive notifications from manufacturers of actively exploited vulnerabilities contained in the products with digital elements, as well as incidents having an impact on the security of these products. ENISA should also forward these notifications to the relevant CSIRTs or, respectively, to the relevant single point of contact designated in accordance with Article [Article X] of Directive [Directive XXX/XXXX (NIS2)] of the Member States, as well as inform the market surveillance authorities. Based on the information it gathers, ENISA should prepare a biennial technical report on emerging trends regarding cybersecurity risks in products with digital elements and submit it to the NIS Cooperation Group. Furthermore, considering ENISA’s expertise, information gathered and threat analyses, ENISA may support the implementation process of this Regulation by proposing joint activities to be conducted by national market surveillance authorities based on indications or information of potential non-compliance with this Regulation of products with digital elements across several Member States or identify categories of products for which simultaneous coordinated control actions may be organised. ENISA may be requested by the Commission to conduct evaluations for specific products in exceptional circumstances in relation to products with digital elements that present a significant cybersecurity risk and where an immediate intervention is required to preserve the good functioning of the internal market. </span>
