          <p>It is necessary to improve the functioning of the internal market by laying down a uniform legal framework for essential cybersecurity requirements for placing products with digital elements on the Union market. Two major problems adding costs for users and society should be addressed: a low level of cybersecurity of products with digital elements, reflected by widespread vulnerabilities and the insufficient and inconsistent provision of security updates to address them, and an insufficient understanding and access to information by users, preventing them from choosing products with adequate cybersecurity properties or using them in a secure manner.</p>

          <p>This Regulation aims to set the boundary conditions for the development of secure products with digital elements by ensuring that hardware and software products are placed on the market with fewer vulnerabilities and that manufactures take security seriously throughout a product’s life cycle. It also aims to create conditions allowing users to take cybersecurity into account when selecting and using products with digital elements.</p>

        <recital eId="rec_3">

          <p>The relevant Union legislation that is currently in force comprises several sets of horizontal rules that address certain aspects linked to cybersecurity from different angles, including measures to improve the security of the digital supply chain. However, the existing Union legislation related to cybersecurity, including [Directive XXX/XXXX (NIS2)] and Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council
                  
                does not directly cover mandatory requirements for the security of products with digital elements.</p>

          <p>While the existing Union legislation applies to certain products with digital elements, there is no horizontal Union regulatory framework establishing comprehensive cybersecurity requirements for all products with digital elements. The various acts and initiatives taken thus far at Union and national levels only partially address the identified cybersecurity-related problems and risks, creating a legislative patchwork within the internal market, increasing legal uncertainty for both manufacturers and users of those products and adding an unnecessary burden on companies to comply with a number of requirements for similar types of products. The cybersecurity of these products has a particularly strong cross-border dimension, as products manufactured in one country are often used by organisations and consumers across the entire internal market. This makes it necessary to regulate the field at Union level. The Union regulatory landscape should be harmonised by introducing cybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements. In addition, certainty for operators and users should be ensured across the Union, as well as a better harmonisation of the single market, creating more viable conditions for operators aiming at entering the Union market.</p>

          <p>At Union level, various programmatic and political documents, such as the EU’s Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital Decade
                  
               , the Council Conclusions of 2 December 2020 and of 23 May 2022 or the Resolution of the European Parliament of 10 June 2021,
                  
                have called for specific Union cybersecurity requirements for digital or connected products, with several countries around the world introducing measures to address this issue on their own initiative. In the final report of the Conference on the Future of Europe,
                  
                citizens called for “a stronger role for the EU in countering cybersecurity threats”.</p>

          <p>To increase the overall level of cybersecurity of all products with digital elements placed on the internal market, it is necessary to introduce objective-oriented and technology-neutral essential cybersecurity requirements for these products that apply horizontally.</p>

          <p>Under certain conditions, all products with digital elements integrated in or connected to a larger electronic information system can serve as an attack vector for malicious actors. As a result, even hardware and software considered as less critical can facilitate the initial compromise of a device or network, enabling malicious actors to gain privileged access to a system or move laterally across systems. Manufacturers should therefore ensure that all connectable products with digital elements are designed and developed in accordance with essential requirements laid down in this Regulation. This includes both products that can be connected physically via hardware interfaces and products that are connected logically, such as via network sockets, pipes, files, application programming interfaces or any other types of software interface. As cybersecurity threats can propagate through various products with digital elements before reaching a certain target, for example by chaining together multiple vulnerability exploits, manufacturers should also ensure the cybersecurity of those products that are only indirectly connected to other devices or networks.</p>

          <p>This Regulation ensures a high level of cybersecurity of products with digital elements. It does not regulate services, such as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), except for remote data processing solutions relating to a product with digital elements understood as any data processing at a distance for which the software is designed and developed by the manufacturer of the product concerned or under the responsibility of that manufacturer, and the absence of which would prevent such a product with digital elements from performing one of its functions. [Directive XXX/XXXX (NIS2)] puts in place cybersecurity and incident reporting requirements for essential and important entities, such as critical infrastructure, with a view to increasing the resilience of the services they provide. [Directive XXX/XXXX (NIS2)] applies to cloud computing services and cloud service models, such as SaaS. All entities providing cloud computing services in the Union that meet or exceed the threshold for medium-sized enterprises fall in the scope of that Directive.</p>

          <p>In order not to hamper innovation or research, free and open-source software developed or supplied outside the course of a commercial activity should not be covered by this Regulation. This is in particular the case for software, including its source code and modified versions, that is openly shared and freely accessible, usable, modifiable and redistributable. In the context of software, a commercial activity might be characterized not only by charging a price for a product, but also by charging a price for technical support services, by providing a software platform through which the manufacturer monetises other services, or by the use of personal data for reasons other than exclusively for improving the security, compatibility or interoperability of the software.</p>

          <p>A secure Internet is indispensable for the functioning of critical infrastructures and for society as a whole. [Directive XXX/XXXX (NIS2)] aims at ensuring a high level of cybersecurity of services provided by essential and important entities, including digital infrastructure providers that support core functions of the open Internet, ensure Internet access and Internet services. It is therefore important that the products with digital elements necessary for digital infrastructure providers to ensure the functioning of the Internet are developed in a secure manner and that they comply with well-established Internet security standards. This Regulation, which applies to all connectable hardware and software products, also aims at facilitating the compliance of digital infrastructure providers with the supply chain requirements under the [Directive XXX/XXXX (NIS2)] by ensuring that the products with digital elements that they use for the provision of their services are developed in a secure manner and that they have access to timely security updates for such products.</p>

          <p>Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council
                  
                lays down rules on medical devices and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council
                  
                lays down rules on in vitro diagnostic medical devices. Both Regulations address cybersecurity risks and follow particular approaches that are also addressed in this Regulation. More specifically, Regulations (EU) 2017/745 and (EU) 2017/746 lay down essential requirements for medical devices that function through an electronic system or that are software themselves. Certain non-embedded software and the whole life cycle approach are also covered by those Regulations. These requirements mandate manufacturers to develop and build their products by applying risk management principles and by setting out requirements concerning IT security measures, as well as corresponding conformity assessment procedures. Furthermore, specific guidance on cybersecurity for medical devices is in place since December 2019, providing manufacturers of medical devices, including in vitro diagnostic devices, with guidance on how to fulfil all the relevant essential requirements of Annex I to those Regulations with regard to cybersecurity.
                  
                Products with digital elements to which either of those Regulations apply should therefore not be subject to this Regulation.</p>

          <p>Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 of the European Parliament and of the Council
                  
                establishes requirements for the type-approval of vehicles, and of their systems and components, introducing certain cybersecurity requirements, including on the operation of a certified cybersecurity management system, on software updates, covering organisations policies and processes for cyber risks related to the entire lifecycle of vehicles, equipment and services in compliance with the applicable United Nations regulations on technical specifications and cybersecurity
                  
               , and providing for specific conformity assessment procedures. In the area of aviation, the principal objective of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council
                  
                is to establish and maintain a high uniform level of civil aviation safety in the Union. It creates a framework for essential requirements for airworthiness for aeronautical products, parts, equipment, including software that take into account obligations to protect against information security threats. Products with digital elements to which Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 applies and those products certified in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 are therefore not subject to the essential requirements and conformity assessment procedures set out in this Regulation., The certification process under Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 ensures the level of assurance aimed for by this Regulation.</p>

          <p>This Regulation lays down horizontal cybersecurity rules which are not specific to sectors or certain products with digital elements. Nevertheless, sectoral or product-specific Union rules could be introduced, laying down requirements that address all or some of the risks covered by the essential requirements laid down by this Regulation. In such cases, the application of this Regulation to products with digital elements covered by other Union rules laying down requirements that address all or some of the risks covered by the essential requirements set out in Annex I of this Regulation may be limited or excluded where such limitation or exclusion is consistent with the overall regulatory framework applying to those products and where the sectoral rules achieve the same level of protection as the one provided for by this Regulation. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts to amend this Regulation by identifying such products and rules. For existing Union legislation where such limitations or exclusions should apply, this Regulation contains specific provisions to clarify its relation with that Union legislation.</p>

          <p>Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/30 specifies that the essential requirements set out in Article 3(3), point (d) (network harm and misuse of network resources), point (e) (personal data and privacy) and point (f) (fraud) of Directive 2014/53/EU apply to certain radio equipment. [Commission implementation decision XXX/2022 on a standardisation request to the European Standardisation Organisations] lays down requirements for the development of specific standards further specifying how these three essential requirements should be addressed. The essential requirements laid down by this Regulation include all the elements of the essential requirements referred to in Article 3(3), points (d), (e) and (f) of Directive 2014/53/EU. Further, the essential requirements laid down in this Regulation are aligned with the objectives of the requirements for specific standards included in that standardisation request. Therefore, if the Commission repeals or amends Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/30 with the consequence that it ceases to apply to certain products subject to this Regulation, the Commission and the European Standardisation Organisations should take into account the standardisation work carried out in the context of Commission Implementing Decision C(2022)5637 on a standardisation request for the RED Delegated Regulation 2022/30 in the preparation and development of harmonised standards to facilitate the implementation of this Regulation.</p>

          <p>Directive 85/374/EEC
                  
                is complementary to this Regulation. That Directive sets out liability rules for defective products so that injured persons can claim compensation when a damage has been caused by defective products. It establishes the principle that the manufacturer of a product is liable for damages caused by a lack of safety in their product irrespective of fault (‘strict liability’). Where such a lack of safety consists in a lack of security updates after placing the product on the market, and this causes damage, the liability of the manufacturer could be triggered. Obligations for manufacturers that concern the provision of such security updates should be laid down in this Regulation.</p>

               , including to provisions for the establishment of data protection certification mechanisms and of data protection seals and marks, for the purpose of demonstrating compliance of processing operations by controllers and processors with that Regulation. Such operations could be embedded in a product with digital elements. Data protection by design and by default, and cybersecurity in general, are key elements of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. By protecting consumers and organisations from cybersecurity risks, the essential cybersecurity requirements laid down in this Regulation, are also to contribute to enhancing the protection of personal data and privacy of individuals. Synergies on both standardisation and certification on cybersecurity aspects should be considered through the cooperation between the Commission, the European Standardisation Organisations, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) established by Regulation (EU) 2016/679, and the national data protection supervisory authorities. Synergies between this Regulation and the Union data protection law should also be created in the area of market surveillance and enforcement. To this end, national market surveillance authorities appointed under this Regulation should cooperate with authorities supervising Union data protection law. The latter should also have access to information relevant for accomplishing their tasks.</p>
