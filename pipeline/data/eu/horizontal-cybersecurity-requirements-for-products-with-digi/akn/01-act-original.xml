        <content>
        <p>(17) This Regulation should be without prejudice to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council , including to provisions for the establishment of data protection certification mechanisms and of data protection seals and marks, for the purpose of demonstrating compliance of processing operations by controllers and processors with that Regulation. Such operations could be embedded in a product with digital elements. Data protection by design and by default, and cybersecurity in general, are key elements of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. By protecting consumers and organisations from cybersecurity risks, the essential cybersecurity requirements laid down in this Regulation, are also to contribute to enhancing the protection of personal data and privacy of individuals. Synergies on both standardisation and certification on cybersecurity aspects should be considered through the cooperation between the Commission, the European Standardisation Organisations, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) established by Regulation (EU) 2016/679, and the national data protection supervisory authorities. Synergies between this Regulation and the Union data protection law should also be created in the area of market surveillance and enforcement. To this end, national market surveillance authorities appointed under this Regulation should cooperate with authorities supervising Union data protection law. The latter should also have access to information relevant for accomplishing their tasks. This Regulation lays down: (a) rules for the placing on the market of products with digital elements to ensure the cybersecurity of such products; (b) essential requirements for the design, development and production of products with digital elements, and obligations for economic operators in relation to these products with respect to cybersecurity; (c) essential requirements for the vulnerability handling processes put in place by manufacturers to ensure the cybersecurity of products with digital elements during the whole life cycle, and obligations for economic operators in relation to these processes; (d) rules on market surveillance and enforcement of the above-mentioned rules and requirements.</p>

        <heading>Article 6 Critical products with digital elements</heading>
        <content>
        <p>1 Products with digital elements that belong to a category which is listed in Annex III shall be considered critical products with digital elements. Products which have the core functionality of a category that is listed in Annex III to this Regulation shall be considered as falling into that category. Categories of critical products with digital elements shall be divided into class I and class II as set out in Annex III, reflecting the level of cybersecurity risk related to these products. 2 The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 50 to amend Annex III by including in the list of categories of critical products with digital elements a new category or withdrawing an existing one from that list. When assessing the need to amend the list in Annex III, the Commission shall take into account the level of cybersecurity risk related to the category of products with digital elements. In determining the level of cybersecurity risk, one or several of the following criteria shall be taken into account: (a) the cybersecurity-related functionality of the product with digital elements, and whether the product with digital elements has at least one of following attributes: (i) it is designed to run with elevated privilege or manage privileges; (ii) it has direct or privileged access to networking or computing resources; (iii) it is designed to control access to data or operational technology; (iv) it performs a function critical to trust, in particular security functions such as network control, endpoint security, and network protection. (b) the intended use in sensitive environments, including in industrial settings or by essential entities of the type referred to in the Annex [Annex I] to the Directive [Directive XXX/XXXX (NIS2)]; (c) the intended use of performing critical or sensitive functions, such as processing of personal data; (d) the potential extent of an adverse impact, in particular in terms of its intensity and its ability to affect a plurality of persons; (e) the extent to which the use of products with digital elements has already caused material or non-material loss or disruption or has given rise to significant concerns in relation to the materialisation of an adverse impact. 3 The Commission is empowered to adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 50 to supplement this Regulation by specifying the definitions of the product categories under class I and class II as set out in Annex III. The delegated act shall be adopted [by 12 months since the entry into force of this Regulation]. 4 Critical products with digital elements shall be subject to the conformity assessment procedures referred to in Article 24(2) and (3). 5 The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 50 to supplement this Regulation by specifying categories of highly critical products with digital elements for which the manufacturers shall be required to obtain a European cybersecurity certificate under a European cybersecurity certification scheme pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/881 to demonstrate conformity with the essential requirements set out in Annex I, or parts thereof. When determining such categories of highly critical products with digital elements, the Commission shall take into account the level of cybersecurity risk related to the category of products with digital elements, in light of one or several of the criteria listed in paragraph 2, as well as in view of the assessment of whether that category of products is: (a) used or relied upon by the essential entities of the type referred to in Annex [Annex I] to the Directive [Directive XXX/ XXXX (NIS2)] or will have potential future significance for the activities of these entities; or (b) relevant for the resilience of the overall supply chain of products with digital elements against disruptive events.</p>

        <content>
        <p>1 When placing a product with digital elements on the market, manufacturers shall ensure that it has been designed, developed and produced in accordance with the essential requirements set out in Section 1 of Annex I. 2 For the purposes of complying with the obligation laid down in paragraph 1, manufacturers shall undertake an assessment of the cybersecurity risks associated with a product with digital elements and take the outcome of that assessment into account during the planning, design, development, production, delivery and maintenance phases of the product with digital elements with a view to minimising cybersecurity risks, preventing security incidents and minimising the impacts of such incidents, including in relation to the health and safety of users. 3 When placing a product with digital elements on the market, the manufacturer shall include a cybersecurity risk assessment in the technical documentation as set out in Article 23 and Annex V. For products with digital elements referred to in Articles 8 and 24(4) that are also subject to other Union acts, the cybersecurity risk assessment may be part of the risk assessment required by those respective Union acts. Where certain essential requirements are not applicable to the marketed product with digital elements, the manufacturer shall include a clear justification in that documentation. 4 For the purposes of complying with the obligation laid down in paragraph 1, manufacturers shall exercise due diligence when integrating components sourced from third parties in products with digital elements. They shall ensure that such components do not compromise the security of the product with digital elements. 5 The manufacturer shall systematically document, in a manner that is proportionate to the nature and the cybersecurity risks, relevant cybersecurity aspects concerning the product with digital elements, including vulnerabilities they become aware of and any relevant information provided by third parties, and, where applicable, update the risk assessment of the product. 6 When placing a product with digital elements on the market, and for the expected product lifetime or for a period of five years from the placing of the product on the market, whichever is shorter, manufacturers shall ensure that vulnerabilities of that product are handled effectively and in accordance with the essential requirements set out in Section 2 of Annex I. Manufacturers shall have appropriate policies and procedures, including coordinated vulnerability disclosure policies, referred to in Section 2, point (5), of Annex I, to process and remediate potential vulnerabilities in the product with digital elements reported from internal or external sources. 7 Before placing a product with digital elements on the market, manufacturers shall draw up the technical documentation referred to in Article 23. They shall carry out the chosen conformity assessment procedures referred to in Article 24 or have them carried out. Where compliance of the product with digital elements with the essential requirements set out in Section 1 of Annex I and of the processes put in place by the manufacturer with the essential requirements set out in Section 2 of Annex I has been demonstrated by that conformity assessment procedure, manufacturers shall draw up the EU declaration of conformity in accordance with Article 20 and affix the CE marking in accordance with Article 22. 8 Manufacturers shall keep the technical documentation and the EU declaration of conformity, where relevant, at the disposal of the market surveillance authorities for ten years after the product with digital elements has been placed on the market. 9 Manufacturers shall ensure that procedures are in place for products with digital elements that are part of a series of production to remain in conformity. The manufacturer shall adequately take into account changes in the development and production process or in the design or characteristics of the product with digital elements and changes in the harmonised standards, European cybersecurity certification schemes or the common specifications referred to in Article 19 by reference to which the conformity of the product with digital elements is declared or by application of which its conformity is verified. 10 Manufacturers shall ensure that products with digital elements are accompanied by the information and instructions set out in Annex II, in an electronic or physical form. Such information and instructions shall be in a language which can be easily understood by users. They shall be clear, understandable, intelligible and legible. They shall allow for a secure installation, operation and use of the products with digital elements. 11 Manufacturers shall either provide the EU declaration of conformity with the product with digital elements or include in the instructions and information set out in Annex II the internet address at which the EU declaration of conformity can be accessed. 12 From the placing on the market and for the expected product lifetime or for a period of five years after the placing on the market of a product with digital elements, whichever is shorter, manufacturers who know or have reason to believe that the product with digital elements or the processes put in place by the manufacturer are not in conformity with the essential requirements set out in Annex I shall immediately take the corrective measures necessary to bring that product with digital elements or the manufacturer’s processes into conformity, to withdraw or to recall the product, as appropriate. 13 Manufacturers shall, further to a reasoned request from a market surveillance authority, provide that authority, in a language which can be easily understood by it, with all the information and documentation, in paper or electronic form, necessary to demonstrate the conformity of the product with digital elements and of the processes put in place by the manufacturer with the essential requirements set out in Annex I. They shall cooperate with that authority, at its request, on any measures taken to eliminate the cybersecurity risks posed by the product with digital elements, which they have placed on the market. 14 A manufacturer that ceases its operations and, as a result, is not able to comply with the obligations laid down in this Regulation shall inform, before the cease of operation takes effect, the relevant market surveillance authorities about this situation, as well as, by any means available and to the extent possible, the users of the concerned products with digital elements placed on the market. 15 The Commission may, by means of implementing acts, specify the format and elements of the software bill of materials set out in Section 2, point (1), of Annex I. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 51(2).</p>

Furthermore, where the product with digital elements presents a significant cybersecurity risk, the importer shall inform the manufacturer and the market surveillance authorities to that effect. 4 Importers shall indicate their name, registered trade name or registered trademark, the postal address and the email address at which they can be contacted on the product with digital elements or, where that is not possible, on its packaging or in a document accompanying the product with digital elements. The contact details shall be in a language easily understood by users and market surveillance authorities. 5 Importers shall ensure that the product with digital elements is accompanied by the instructions and information set out in Annex II in a language which can be easily understood by users. 6 Importers who know or have reason to believe that a product with digital elements, which they have placed on the market, or the processes put in place by its manufacturer, are not in conformity with the essential requirements set out in Annex I shall immediately take the corrective measures necessary to bring that product with digital elements or the processes put in place by its manufacturer into conformity with the essential requirements set out in Annex I, or to withdraw or recall the product, if appropriate. Upon identifying a vulnerability in the product with digital elements, importers shall inform the manufacturer without undue delay about that vulnerability. Furthermore, where the product with digital elements presents a significant cybersecurity risk, importers shall immediately inform the market surveillance authorities of the Member States in which they made the product with digital elements available on the market to that effect, giving details, in particular, of the non-conformity and of any corrective measures taken. 7 Importers shall, for ten years after the product with digital elements has been placed on the market, keep a copy of the EU declaration of conformity at the disposal of the market surveillance authorities and ensure that the technical documentation can be made available to those authorities, upon request. 8 Importers shall, further to a reasoned request from a market surveillance authority, provide it with all the information and documentation, in paper or electronic form, necessary to demonstrate the conformity of the product with digital elements with the essential requirements set out in Section 1 of Annex I as well as of the processes put in place by the manufacturer with the essential requirements set out in Section 2 of Annex I in a language that can be easily understood by that authority. They shall cooperate with that authority, at its request, on any measures taken to eliminate the cybersecurity risks posed by a product with digital elements, which they have placed on the market. 9 When the importer of a product with digital elements becomes aware that the manufacturer of that product ceased its operations and, as result, is not able to comply with the obligations laid down in this Regulation, the importer shall inform the relevant market surveillance authorities about this situation, as well as, by any means available and to the extent possible, the users of the products with digital elements placed on the market.</p>

        <heading>Article 29 Requirements relating to notified bodies</heading>
        <content>
        <p>1 For the purposes of notification, a conformity assessment body shall meet the requirements laid down in paragraphs 2 to 12. 2 A conformity assessment body shall be established under national law and have legal personality. 3 A conformity assessment body shall be a third-party body independent of the organisation or the product it assesses. A body belonging to a business association or professional federation representing undertakings involved in the design, development, production, provision, assembly, use or maintenance of products with digital elements which it assesses, may, on condition that its independence and the absence of any conflict of interest are demonstrated, be considered such a body. 4 A conformity assessment body, its top level management and the personnel responsible for carrying out the conformity assessment tasks shall not be the designer, developer, manufacturer, supplier, installer, purchaser, owner, user or maintainer of the products with digital elements which they assess, nor the authorised representative of any of those parties. This shall not preclude the use of assessed products that are necessary for the operations of the conformity assessment body or the use of such products for personal purposes. A conformity assessment body, its top level management and the personnel responsible for carrying out the conformity assessment tasks shall not be directly involved in the design, development, production, the marketing, installation, use or maintenance of those products, or represent the parties engaged in those activities. They shall not engage in any activity that may conflict with their independence of judgement or integrity in relation to conformity assessment activities for which they are notified. This shall in particular apply to consultancy services. Conformity assessment bodies shall ensure that the activities of their subsidiaries or subcontractors do not affect the confidentiality, objectivity or impartiality of their conformity assessment activities. 5 Conformity assessment bodies and their personnel shall carry out the conformity assessment activities with the highest degree of professional integrity and the requisite technical competence in the specific field and shall be free from all pressures and inducements, particularly financial, which might influence their judgement or the results of their conformity assessment activities, especially as regards persons or groups of persons with an interest in the results of those activities. 6 A conformity assessment body shall be capable of carrying out all the conformity assessment tasks referred to in Annex VI and in relation to which it has been notified, regardless of whether those tasks are carried out by the conformity assessment body itself or on its behalf and under its responsibility. At all times and for each conformity assessment procedure and each kind or category of products with digital elements in relation to which it has been notified, a conformity assessment body shall have at its disposal the necessary: (a) staff with technical knowledge and sufficient and appropriate experience to perform the conformity assessment tasks; (b) descriptions of procedures in accordance with which conformity assessment is carried out, ensuring the transparency and the ability of reproduction of those procedures. It shall have appropriate policies and procedures in place that distinguish between tasks it carries out as a notified body and other activities; (c) procedures for the performance of activities which take due account of the size of an undertaking, the sector in which it operates, its structure, the degree of complexity of the product technology in question and the mass or serial nature of the production process. It shall have the means necessary to perform the technical and administrative tasks connected with the conformity assessment activities in an appropriate manner and shall have access to all necessary equipment or facilities. 7 The personnel responsible for carrying out conformity assessment activities shall have the following: (a) sound technical and vocational training covering all the conformity assessment activities in relation to which the conformity assessment body has been notified; (b) satisfactory knowledge of the requirements of the assessments they carry out and adequate authority to carry out those assessments; (c) appropriate knowledge and understanding of the essential requirements, of the applicable harmonised standards and of the relevant provisions of Union harmonisation legislation and of its implementing acts; (d) the ability to draw up certificates, records and reports demonstrating that assessments have been carried out. 8 The impartiality of the conformity assessment bodies, their top level management and of the assessment personnel shall be guaranteed. The remuneration of the top level management and assessment personnel of a conformity assessment body shall not depend on the number of assessments carried out or on the results of those assessments. 9 Conformity assessment bodies shall take out liability insurance unless liability is assumed by the State in accordance with national law, or the Member State itself is directly responsible for the conformity assessment. 10 The personnel of a conformity assessment body shall observe professional secrecy with regard to all information obtained in carrying out their tasks under Annex VI or any provision of national law giving effect to it, except in relation to the market surveillance authorities of the Member State in which its activities are carried out. Proprietary rights shall be protected. The conformity assessment body shall have documented procedures ensuring compliance with this paragraph. 11 Conformity assessment bodies shall participate in, or ensure that their assessment personnel are informed of, the relevant standardisation activities and the activities of the notified body coordination group established under Article 40 and apply as general guidance the administrative decisions and documents produced as a result of the work of that group. 12 Conformity assessment bodies shall operate in accordance with a set of consistent, fair and reasonable terms and conditions, in particular taking into account the interests of SMEs in relation to fees.</p>

        <p>1 Notified bodies shall carry out conformity assessments in accordance with the conformity assessment procedures provided for in Article 24 and Annex VI. 2 Conformity assessments shall be carried out in a proportionate manner, avoiding unnecessary burdens for economic operators. Conformity assessment bodies shall perform their activities taking due account of the size of an undertaking, the sector in which it operates, its structure, the degree of complexity of the product technology in question and the mass or serial nature of the production process. 3 Notified bodies shall however respect the degree of rigour and the level of protection required for the compliance of the product with the provisions of Regulation. 4 Where a notified body finds that requirements laid down in Annex I or in corresponding harmonised standards or in common specifications as referred to in Article 19 have not been met by a manufacturer, it shall require that manufacturer to take appropriate corrective measures and shall not issue a conformity certificate. 5 Where, in the course of the monitoring of conformity following the issuance of a certificate, a notified body finds that a product no longer complies with the requirements laid down in this Regulation, it shall require the manufacturer to take appropriate corrective measures and shall suspend or withdraw the certificate if necessary. 6 Where corrective measures are not taken or do not have the required effect, the notified body shall restrict, suspend or withdraw any certificates, as appropriate.</p>

        <p>1 Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 shall apply to the products with digital elements within the scope of this Regulation. 2 Each Member State shall designate one or more market surveillance authorities for the purpose of ensuring the effective implementation of this Regulation. Member States may designate an existing or new authority to act as market surveillance authority for this Regulation. 3 Where relevant, the market surveillance authorities shall cooperate with the national cybersecurity certification authorities designated under Article 58 of Regulation (EU) 2019/881 and exchange information on a regular basis. With respect to the supervision of the implementation of the reporting obligations pursuant to Article 11 of this Regulation, the designated market surveillance authorities shall cooperate with ENISA. 4 Where relevant, the market surveillance authorities shall cooperate with other market surveillance authorities designated on the basis of other Union harmonisation legislation for other products, and exchange information on a regular basis. 5 Market surveillance authorities shall cooperate, as appropriate, with the authorities supervising Union data protection law. Such cooperation includes informing these authorities of any finding relevant for the fulfilment of their competences, including when issuing guidance and advice pursuant to paragraph 8 of this Article if such guidance and advice concerns the processing of personal data. Authorities supervising Union data protection law shall have the power to request and access any documentation created or maintained under this Regulation when access to that documentation is necessary for the fulfilment of their tasks. They shall inform the designated market surveillance authorities of the Member State concerned of any such request. 6 Member States shall ensure that the designated market surveillance authorities are provided with adequate financial and human resources to fulfil their tasks under this Regulation. 7 The Commission shall facilitate the exchange of experience between designated market surveillance authorities. 8 Market surveillance authorities may provide guidance and advice to economic operators on the implementation of this Regulation, with the support of the Commission. 9 The market surveillance authorities shall report to the Commission on an annual basis the outcomes of relevant market surveillance activities. The designated market surveillance authorities shall report, without delay, to the Commission and relevant national competition authorities any information identified in the course of market surveillance activities that may be of potential interest for the application of Union competition law. 10 For products with digital elements in the scope of this Regulation classified as high-risk AI systems according to Article [Article 6] of the Regulation [the AI Regulation], the market surveillance authorities designated for the purposes of the Regulation [the AI Regulation] shall be the authorities responsible for market surveillance activities required under this Regulation. The market surveillance authorities designated pursuant to Regulation [the AI Regulation] shall cooperate, as appropriate, with the market surveillance authorities designated pursuant to this Regulation and, with respect to the supervision of the implementation of the reporting obligations pursuant to Article 11, with ENISA. Market surveillance authorities designated pursuant to Regulation [the AI Regulation] shall in particular inform market surveillance authorities designated pursuant to this Regulation of any finding relevant for the fulfilment of their tasks in relation to the implementation of this Regulation. 11 A dedicated administrative cooperation group (ADCO) shall be established for the uniform application of this Regulation, pursuant to Article 30(2) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020. This ADCO shall be composed of representatives of the designated market surveillance authorities and, if appropriate, representatives of single liaison offices.</p>

        <content>
        <p>1 Where the market surveillance authority of a Member State has sufficient reasons to consider that a product with digital elements, including its vulnerability handling, presents a significant cybersecurity risk, it shall carry out an evaluation of the product with digital elements concerned in respect of its compliance with all the requirements laid down in this Regulation. The relevant economic operators shall cooperate as necessary with the market surveillance authority. Where, in the course of that evaluation, the market surveillance authority finds that the product with digital elements does not comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation, it shall without delay require the relevant operator to take all appropriate corrective actions to bring the product into compliance with those requirements, to withdraw it from the market, or to recall it within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk, as it may prescribe. The market surveillance authority shall inform the relevant notified body accordingly. Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 shall apply to the appropriate corrective actions. 2 Where the market surveillance authority considers that non-compliance is not restricted to its national territory, it shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of the results of the evaluation and of the actions which it has required the operator to take. 3 The manufacturer shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all the products with digital elements concerned that it has made available on the market throughout the Union. 4 Where the manufacturer of a product with digital elements does not take adequate corrective action within the period referred to in paragraph 1, second subparagraph, the market surveillance authority shall take all appropriate provisional measures to prohibit or restrict that product being made available on its national market, to withdraw it from that market or to recall it. That authority shall inform the Commission and the other Member States, without delay, of those measures. 5 The information referred to in paragraph 4 shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the non-compliant products with digital elements, the origin of the product with digital elements, the nature of the alleged non-compliance and the risk involved, the nature and duration of the national measures taken and the arguments put forward by the relevant operator. In particular, the market surveillance authority shall indicate whether the non-compliance is due to one or more of the following: (a) a failure of the product or of the processes put in place by the manufacturer to meet the essential requirements set out in Annex I; (b) shortcomings in the harmonised standards, cybersecurity certification schemes, or common specifications, referred to in Article 18. 6 The market surveillance authorities of the Member States other than the market surveillance authority of the Member State initiating the procedure shall without delay inform the Commission and the other Member States of any measures adopted and of any additional information at their disposal relating to the non-compliance of the product concerned, and, in the event of disagreement with the notified national measure, of their objections. 7 Where, within three months of receipt of the information referred to in paragraph 4, no objection has been raised by either a Member State or the Commission in respect of a provisional measure taken by a Member State, that measure shall be deemed justified. This is without prejudice to the procedural rights of the operator concerned in accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020. 8 The market surveillance authorities of all Member States shall ensure that appropriate restrictive measures are taken in respect of the product concerned, such as withdrawal of the product from their market, without delay.</p>

On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide whether the national measure is justified or not within nine months from the notification referred to in Article 43(4) and notify such decision to the Member State concerned. 2 If the national measure is considered justified, all Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the non-compliant product with digital elements is withdrawn from their market, and shall inform the Commission accordingly. If the national measure is considered unjustified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw the measure. 3 Where the national measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the product with digital elements is attributed to shortcomings in the harmonised standards, the Commission shall apply the procedure provided for in Article 10 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012. 4 Where the national measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the product with digital elements is attributed to shortcomings in a European cybersecurity certification scheme as referred to in Article 18, the Commission shall consider whether to amend or repeal the implementing act as referred to in Article 18(4) that specifies the presumption of conformity concerning that certification scheme. 5 Where the national measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the product with digital elements is attributed to shortcomings in common specifications as referred to in Article 19, the Commission shall consider whether to amend or repeal the implementing act referred to in Article 19 setting out those common specifications.</p>

        <p>1 Where, having performed an evaluation under Article 43, the market surveillance authority of a Member State finds that although a product with digital elements and the processes put in place by the manufacturer are in compliance with this Regulation, they present a significant cybersecurity risk and, in addition, they pose a risk to the health or safety of persons, to the compliance with obligations under Union or national law intended to protect fundamental rights, the availability authenticity, integrity or confidentiality of services offered using an electronic information system by essential entities of the type referred to in [Annex I to Directive XXX / XXXX (NIS2)] or to other aspects of public interest protection, it shall require the relevant operator to take all appropriate measures to ensure that the product with digital elements and the processes put in place by the manufacturer concerned, when placed on the market, no longer present that risk, to withdraw the product with digital elements from the market or to recall it within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk. 2 The manufacturer or other relevant operators shall ensure that corrective action is taken in respect of the products with digital elements concerned that they have made available on the market throughout the Union within the timeline established by the market surveillance authority of the Member State referred to in paragraph 1. 3 The Member State shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States about the measures taken pursuant to paragraph 1. That information shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the products with digital elements concerned, the origin and the supply chain of those products with digital elements, the nature of the risk involved and the nature and duration of the national measures taken. 4 The Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator and shall evaluate the national measures taken. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide whether the measure is justified or not and, where necessary, propose appropriate measures. 5 The Commission shall address its decision to the Member States. 6 Where the Commission has sufficient reasons to consider, including based on information provided by ENISA, that a product with digital elements, although compliant with this Regulation, presents the risks referred to in paragraph 1, it may request the relevant market surveillance authority or authorities to carry out an evaluation of compliance and follow the procedures referred to in Article 43 and paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article. 7 In exceptional circumstances which justify an immediate intervention to preserve the good functioning of the internal market and where the Commission has sufficient reasons to consider that the product referred to in paragraph 6 continues to present the risks referred to in paragraph 1 and no effective measures have been taken by the relevant national market surveillance authorities, the Commission may request ENISA to carry out an evaluation of the risks presented by that product and shall inform the relevant market surveillance authorities accordingly.
