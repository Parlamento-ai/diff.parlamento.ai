Where certain essential cybersecurity requirements are not applicable to the product with digital elements, the manufacturer shall include a clear justification to that effect in that technical documentation. 5 For the purpose of complying with paragraph 1, manufacturers shall exercise due diligence when integrating components sourced from third parties so that those components do not compromise the cybersecurity of the product with digital elements, including when integrating components of free and open-source software that have not been made available on the market in the course of a commercial activity. 6 Manufacturers shall, upon identifying a vulnerability in a component, including in an open source-component, which is integrated in the product with digital elements report the vulnerability to the person or entity manufacturing or maintaining the component, and address and remediate the vulnerability in accordance with the vulnerability handling requirements set out in Part II of Annex I. Where manufacturers have developed a software or hardware modification to address the vulnerability in that component, they shall share the relevant code or documentation with the person or entity manufacturing or maintaining the component, where appropriate in a machine-readable format. 7 The manufacturers shall systematically document, in a manner that is proportionate to the nature and the cybersecurity risks, relevant cybersecurity aspects concerning the products with digital elements, including vulnerabilities of which they become aware and any relevant information provided by third parties, and shall, where applicable, update the cybersecurity risk assessment of the products. 8 Manufacturers shall ensure, when placing a product with digital elements on the market, and for the support period, that vulnerabilities of that product, including its components, are handled effectively and in accordance with the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Part II of Annex I. Manufacturers shall determine the support period so that it reflects the length of time during which the product is expected to be in use, taking into account, in particular, reasonable user expectations, the nature of the product, including its intended purpose, as well as relevant Union law determining the lifetime of products with digital elements. When determining the support period, manufacturers may also take into account the support periods of products with digital elements offering a similar functionality placed on the market by other manufacturers, the availability of the operating environment, the support periods of integrated components that provide core functions and are sourced from third parties as well as relevant guidance provided by the dedicated administrative cooperation group (ADCO) established pursuant to Article 52(15) and the Commission. The matters to be taken into account in order to determine the support period shall be considered in a manner that ensures proportionality. Without prejudice to the second subparagraph, the support period shall be at least five years. Where the product with digital elements is expected to be in use for less than five years, the support period shall correspond to the expected use time. Taking into account ADCO recommendations as referred to in Article 52(16), the Commission may adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 61 to supplement this Regulation by specifying the minimum support period for specific product categories where the market surveillance data suggests inadequate support periods. Manufacturers shall include the information that was taken into account to determine the support period of a product with digital elements in the technical documentation as set out in Annex VII. Manufacturers shall have appropriate policies and procedures, including coordinated vulnerability disclosure policies, referred to in Part II, point (5), of Annex I to process and remediate potential vulnerabilities in the product with digital elements reported from internal or external sources. 9 Manufacturers shall ensure that each security update, as referred to in Part II, point (8), of Annex I, which has been made available to users during the support period, remains available after it has been issued for a minimum of 10 years or for the remainder of the support period, whichever is longer. 10 Where a manufacturer has placed subsequent substantially modified versions of a software product on the market, that manufacturer may ensure compliance with the essential cybersecurity requirement set out in Part II, point (2), of Annex I only for the version that it has last placed on the market, provided that the users of the versions that were previously placed on the market have access to the version last placed on the market free of charge and do not incur additional costs to adjust the hardware and software environment in which they use the original version of that product. 11 Manufacturers may maintain public software archives enhancing user access to historical versions. In those cases, users shall be clearly informed in an easily accessible manner about risks associated with using unsupported software. 12 Before placing a product with digital elements on the market, manufacturers shall draw up the technical documentation referred to in Article 31. They shall carry out the chosen conformity assessment procedures as referred to in Article 32 or have them carried out. Where compliance of the product with digital elements with the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Part I of Annex I and of the processes put in place by the manufacturer with the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Part II of Annex I has been demonstrated by that conformity assessment procedure, manufacturers shall draw up the EU declaration of conformity in accordance with Article 28 and affix the CE marking in accordance with Article 30. 13 Manufacturers shall keep the technical documentation and the EU declaration of conformity at the disposal of the market surveillance authorities for at least 10 years after the product with digital elements has been placed on the market or for the support period, whichever is longer. 14 Manufacturers shall ensure that procedures are in place for products with digital elements that are part of a series of production to remain in conformity with this Regulation. Manufacturers shall adequately take into account changes in the development and production process or in the design or characteristics of the product with digital elements and changes in the harmonised standards, European cybersecurity certification schemes or common specifications as referred to in Article 27 by reference to which the conformity of the product with digital elements is declared or by application of which its conformity is verified. 15 Manufacturers shall ensure that their products with digital elements bear a type, batch or serial number or other element allowing their identification, or, where that is not possible, that that information is provided on their packaging or in a document accompanying the product with digital elements. 16 Manufacturers shall indicate the name, registered trade name or registered trademark of the manufacturer, and the postal address, email address or other digital contact details, as well as, where applicable, the website where the manufacturer can be contacted, on the product with digital elements, on its packaging or in a document accompanying the product with digital elements. That information shall also be included in the information and instructions to the user set out in Annex II. The contact details shall be in a language which can be easily understood by users and market surveillance authorities. 17 For the purposes of this Regulation, manufacturers shall designate a single point of contact to enable users to communicate directly and rapidly with them, including in order to facilitate reporting on vulnerabilities of the product with digital elements. Manufacturers shall ensure that the single point of contact is easily identifiable by the users. They shall also include the single point of contact in the information and instructions to the user set out in Annex II. The single point of contact shall allow users to choose their preferred means of communication and shall not limit such means to automated tools. 18 Manufacturers shall ensure that products with digital elements are accompanied by the information and instructions to the user set out in Annex II, in paper or electronic form. Such information and instructions shall be provided in a language which can be easily understood by users and market surveillance authorities. They shall be clear, understandable, intelligible and legible. They shall allow for the secure installation, operation and use of products with digital elements. Manufacturers shall keep the information and instructions to the user set out in Annex II at the disposal of users and market surveillance authorities for at least 10 years after the product with digital elements has been placed on the market or for the support period, whichever is longer. Where such information and instructions are provided online, manufacturers shall ensure that they are accessible, user-friendly and available online for at least 10 years after the product with digital elements has been placed on the market or for the support period, whichever is longer. 19 Manufacturers shall ensure that the end date of the support period referred to in paragraph 8, including at least the month and the year, is clearly and understandably specified at the time of purchase in an easily accessible manner and, where applicable, on the product with digital elements, its packaging or by digital means. Where technically feasible in light of the nature of the product with digital elements, manufacturers shall display a notification to users informing them that their product with digital elements has reached the end of its support period. 20 Manufacturers shall either provide a copy of the EU declaration of conformity or a simplified EU declaration of conformity with the product with digital elements. Where a simplified EU declaration of conformity is provided, it shall contain the exact internet address at which the full EU declaration of conformity can be accessed. 21 From the placing on the market and for the support period, manufacturers who know or have reason to believe that the product with digital elements or the processes put in place by the manufacturer are not in conformity with the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Annex I shall immediately take the corrective measures necessary to bring that product with digital elements or the manufacturer’s processes into conformity, or to withdraw or recall the product, as appropriate. 22 Manufacturers shall, upon a reasoned request from a market surveillance authority, provide that authority, in a language which can be easily understood by that authority, with all the information and documentation, in paper or electronic form, necessary to demonstrate the conformity of the product with digital elements and of the processes put in place by the manufacturer with the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Annex I. Manufacturers shall cooperate with that authority, at its request, on any measures taken to eliminate the cybersecurity risks posed by the product with digital elements which they have placed on the market. 23 A manufacturer that ceases its operations and, as a result, is not able to comply with this Regulation shall inform, before the cessation of operations takes effect, the relevant market surveillance authorities as well as, by any means available and to the extent possible, the users of the relevant products with digital elements placed on the market, of the impending cessation of operations. 24 The Commission may, by means of implementing acts taking into account European or international standards and best practices, specify the format and elements of the software bill of materials referred to in Part II, point (1), of Annex I. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 62(2). 25 In order to assess the dependence of Member States and of the Union as a whole on software components and in particular on components qualifying as free and open-source software, ADCO may decide to conduct a Union wide dependency assessment for specific categories of products with digital elements. For that purpose, market surveillance authorities may request manufacturers of such categories of products with digital elements to provide the relevant software bills of materials as referred to in Part II, point (1), of Annex I. On the basis of such information, the market surveillance authorities may provide ADCO with anonymised and aggregated information about software dependencies. ADCO shall submit a report on the results of the dependency assessment to the Cooperation Group established pursuant to Article 14 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555.</p>

        <content>
        <p>1 A manufacturer shall notify any actively exploited vulnerability contained in the product with digital elements that it becomes aware of simultaneously to the CSIRT designated as coordinator, in accordance with paragraph 7 of this Article, and to ENISA. The manufacturer shall notify that actively exploited vulnerability via the single reporting platform established pursuant to Article 16. 2 For the purposes of the notification referred to in paragraph 1, the manufacturer shall submit:(a)an early warning notification of an actively exploited vulnerability, without undue delay and in any event within 24 hours of the manufacturer becoming aware of it, indicating, where applicable, the Member States on the territory of which the manufacturer is aware that their product with digital elements has been made available;(b)unless the relevant information has already been provided, a vulnerability notification, without undue delay and in any event within 72 hours of the manufacturer becoming aware of the actively exploited vulnerability, which shall provide general information, as available, about the product with digital elements concerned, the general nature of the exploit and of the vulnerability concerned as well as any corrective or mitigating measures taken, and corrective or mitigating measures that users can take, and which shall also indicate, where applicable, how sensitive the manufacturer considers the notified information to be;(c)unless the relevant information has already been provided, a final report, no later than 14 days after a corrective or mitigating measure is available, including at least the following:(i)a description of the vulnerability, including its severity and impact;(ii)where available, information concerning any malicious actor that has exploited or that is exploiting the vulnerability;(iii)details about the security update or other corrective measures that have been made available to remedy the vulnerability. 3 A manufacturer shall notify any severe incident having an impact on the security of the product with digital elements that it becomes aware of simultaneously to the CSIRT designated as coordinator, in accordance with paragraph 7 of this Article, and to ENISA. The manufacturer shall notify that incident via the single reporting platform established pursuant to Article 16. 4 For the purposes of the notification referred to in paragraph 3, the manufacturer shall submit:(a)an early warning notification of a severe incident having an impact on the security of the product with digital elements, without undue delay and in any event within 24 hours of the manufacturer becoming aware of it, including at least whether the incident is suspected of being caused by unlawful or malicious acts, which shall also indicate, where applicable, the Member States on the territory of which the manufacturer is aware that their product with digital elements has been made available;(b)unless the relevant information has already been provided, an incident notification, without undue delay and in any event within 72 hours of the manufacturer becoming aware of the incident, which shall provide general information, where available, about the nature of the incident, an initial assessment of the incident, as well as any corrective or mitigating measures taken, and corrective or mitigating measures that users can take, and which shall also indicate, where applicable, how sensitive the manufacturer considers the notified information to be;(c)unless the relevant information has already been provided, a final report, within one month after the submission of the incident notification under point (b), including at least the following:(i)a detailed description of the incident, including its severity and impact;(ii)the type of threat or root cause that is likely to have triggered the incident;(iii)applied and ongoing mitigation measures. 5 For the purposes of paragraph 3, an incident having an impact on the security of the product with digital elements shall be considered to be severe where:(a)it negatively affects or is capable of negatively affecting the ability of a product with digital elements to protect the availability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality of sensitive or important data or functions; or(b)it has led or is capable of leading to the introduction or execution of malicious code in a product with digital elements or in the network and information systems of a user of the product with digital elements. 6 Where necessary, the CSIRT designated as coordinator initially receiving the notification may request manufacturers to provide an intermediate report on relevant status updates about the actively exploited vulnerability or severe incident having an impact on the security of the product with digital elements. 7 The notifications referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3 of this Article shall be submitted via the single reporting platform referred to in Article 16 using one of the electronic notification end-points referred to in Article 16(1). The notification shall be submitted using the electronic notification end-point of the CSIRT designated as coordinator of the Member State where the manufacturers have their main establishment in the Union and shall be simultaneously accessible to ENISA. For the purposes of this Regulation, a manufacturer shall be considered to have its main establishment in the Union in the Member State where the decisions related to the cybersecurity of its products with digital elements are predominantly taken. If such a Member State cannot be determined, the main establishment shall be considered to be in the Member State where the manufacturer concerned has the establishment with the highest number of employees in the Union. Where a manufacturer has no main establishment in the Union, it shall submit the notifications referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3 using the electronic notification end-point of the CSIRT designated as coordinator in the Member State determined pursuant to the following order and based on the information available to the manufacturer:(a)the Member State in which the authorised representative acting on behalf of the manufacturer for the highest number of products with digital elements of that manufacturer is established;(b)the Member State in which the importer placing on the market the highest number of products with digital elements of that manufacturer is established;(c)the Member State in which the distributor making available on the market the highest number of products with digital elements of that manufacturer is established;(d)the Member State in which the highest number of users of products with digital elements of that manufacturer are located. In relation to the third subparagraph, point (d), a manufacturer may submit notifications related to any subsequent actively exploited vulnerability or severe incident having an impact on the security of the product with digital elements to the same CSIRT designated as coordinator to which it first reported. 8 After becoming aware of an actively exploited vulnerability or a severe incident having an impact on the security of the product with digital elements, the manufacturer shall inform the impacted users of the product with digital elements, and where appropriate all users, of that vulnerability or incident and, where necessary, of any risk mitigation and corrective measures that the users can deploy to mitigate the impact of that vulnerability or incident, where appropriate in a structured, machine-readable format that is easily automatically processable. Where the manufacturer fails to inform the users of the product with digital elements in a timely manner, the notified CSIRTs designated as coordinators may provide such information to the users when considered to be proportionate and necessary for preventing or mitigating the impact of that vulnerability or incident. 9 By , the Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 61 of this Regulation to supplement this Regulation by specifying the terms and conditions for applying the cybersecurity-related grounds in relation to delaying the dissemination of notifications as referred to in Article 16(2) of this Regulation. The Commission shall cooperate with the CSIRTs network established pursuant to Article 15 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555 and ENISA in preparing the draft delegated acts. 11 December 2025 10 The Commission may, by means of implementing acts, specify further the format and procedures of the notifications referred to in this Article as well as in Articles 15 and 16. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 62(2). The Commission shall cooperate with the CSIRTs network and ENISA in preparing those draft implementing acts.</p>

        <heading>Article 16 Establishment of a single reporting platform</heading>
        <content>
        <p>1 For the purposes of the notifications referred to in Article 14(1) and (3) and Article 15(1) and (2) and in order to simplify the reporting obligations of manufacturers, a single reporting platform shall be established by ENISA. The day-to-day operations of that single reporting platform shall be managed and maintained by ENISA. The architecture of the single reporting platform shall allow Member States and ENISA to put in place their own electronic notification end-points. 2 After receiving a notification, the CSIRT designated as coordinator initially receiving the notification shall, without delay, disseminate the notification via the single reporting platform to the CSIRTs designated as coordinators on the territory of which the manufacturer has indicated that the product with digital elements has been made available. In exceptional circumstances and, in particular, upon request by the manufacturer and in light of the level of sensitivity of the notified information as indicated by the manufacturer under Article 14(2), point (a), of this Regulation, the dissemination of the notification may be delayed based on justified cybersecurity-related grounds for a period of time that is strictly necessary, including where a vulnerability is subject to a coordinated vulnerability disclosure procedure as referred to in Article 12(1) of Directive (EU) 2022/2555. Where a CSIRT decides to withhold a notification, it shall immediately inform ENISA about the decision and provide both a justification for withholding the notification as well as an indication of when it will disseminate the notification in accordance with the dissemination procedure laid down in this paragraph. ENISA may support the CSIRT on the application of cybersecurity-related grounds in relation to delaying the dissemination of the notification. In particularly exceptional circumstances, where the manufacturer indicates in the notification referred to in Article 14(2), point (b):(a)that the notified vulnerability has been actively exploited by a malicious actor and, according to the information available, it has been exploited in no other Member State than the one of the CSIRT designated as coordinator to which the manufacturer has notified the vulnerability;(b)that any immediate further dissemination of the notified vulnerability would likely result in the supply of information the disclosure of which would be contrary to the essential interests of that Member State; or(c)that the notified vulnerability poses an imminent high cybersecurity risk stemming from the further dissemination;only the information that a notification was made by the manufacturer, the general information about the product, the information on the general nature of the exploit and the information that security related grounds were raised are to be made available simultaneously to ENISA until the full notification is disseminated to the CSIRTs concerned and ENISA. Where, based on that information, ENISA considers that there is a systemic risk affecting security in the internal market, it shall recommend to the recipient CSIRT that it disseminate the full notification to the other CSIRTs designated as coordinators and to ENISA itself. 3 After receiving a notification of an actively exploited vulnerability in a product with digital elements or of a severe incident having an impact on the security of a product with digital elements, the CSIRTs designated as coordinators shall provide the market surveillance authorities of their respective Member States with the notified information necessary for the market surveillance authorities to fulfil their obligations under this Regulation. 4 ENISA shall take appropriate and proportionate technical, operational and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of the single reporting platform and the information submitted or disseminated via the single reporting platform. It shall notify without undue delay any security incident affecting the single reporting platform to the CSIRTs network as well as to the Commission. 5 ENISA, in cooperation with the CSIRTs network, shall provide and implement specifications on the technical, operational and organisational measures regarding the establishment, maintenance and secure operation of the single reporting platform referred to in paragraph 1, including at least the security arrangements related to the establishment, operation and maintenance of the single reporting platform, as well as the electronic notification end-points set up by the CSIRTs designated as coordinators at national level and ENISA at Union level, including procedural aspects to ensure that, where a notified vulnerability has no corrective or mitigating measures available, information about that vulnerability is shared in line with strict security protocols and on a need-to-know basis. 6 Where a CSIRT designated as coordinator has been made aware of an actively exploited vulnerability as part of a coordinated vulnerability disclosure procedure as referred to in Article 12(1) of Directive (EU) 2022/2555, the CSIRT designated as coordinator initially receiving the notification may delay the dissemination of the relevant notification via the single reporting platform based on justified cybersecurity-related grounds for a period that is no longer than is strictly necessary and until consent for disclosure by the involved coordinated vulnerability disclosure parties is given. That requirement shall not prevent manufacturers from notifying such a vulnerability on a voluntary basis in accordance with the procedure laid down in this Article.</p>

        <content>
        <p>1 Products with digital elements and processes put in place by the manufacturer which are in conformity with harmonised standards or parts thereof, the references of which have been published in the , shall be presumed to be in conformity with the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Annex I covered by those standards or parts thereof. Official Journal of the European Union The Commission shall, in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, request one or more European standardisation organisations to draft harmonised standards for the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Annex I to this Regulation. When preparing standardisation requests for this Regulation, the Commission shall strive to take into account existing European and international standards for cybersecurity that are in place or under development in order to simplify the development of harmonised standards, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012. 2 The Commission may adopt implementing acts establishing common specifications covering technical requirements that provide a means to comply with the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Annex I for products with digital elements that fall within the scope of this Regulation. Those implementing acts shall be adopted only where the following conditions are fulfilled:(a)the Commission has requested, pursuant to Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, one or more European standardisation organisations to draft a harmonised standard for the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Annex I and:(i)the request has not been accepted;(ii)the harmonised standards addressing that request are not delivered within the deadline set in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012; or(iii)the harmonised standards do not comply with the request; and(b)no reference to harmonised standards covering the relevant essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Annex I to this Regulation has been published in the in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 and no such reference is expected to be published within a reasonable period. Official Journal of the European Union Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 62(2). 3 Before preparing the draft implementing act referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, the Commission shall inform the committee referred to in Article 22 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 that it considers that the conditions in paragraph 2 of this Article have been fulfilled. 4 When preparing the draft implementing act referred to in paragraph 2, the Commission shall take into account the views of relevant bodies and shall duly consult all relevant stakeholders. 5 Products with digital elements and processes put in place by the manufacturer which are in conformity with the common specifications established by implementing acts referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, or parts thereof, shall be presumed to be in conformity with the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Annex I covered by those common specifications or parts thereof. 6 Where a harmonised standard is adopted by a European standardisation organisation and proposed to the Commission for the purpose of publishing its reference in the , the Commission shall assess the harmonised standard in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012. When a reference of a harmonised standard is published in the , the Commission shall repeal the implementing acts referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, or parts thereof which cover the same essential cybersecurity requirements as those covered by that harmonised standard. Official Journal of the European Union Official Journal of the European Union 7 Where a Member State considers that a common specification does not entirely satisfy the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Annex I, it shall inform the Commission thereof by submitting a detailed explanation. The Commission shall assess that detailed explanation and may, if appropriate, amend the implementing act establishing the common specification in question. 8 Products with digital elements and processes put in place by the manufacturer for which an EU statement of conformity or certificate has been issued under a European cybersecurity certification scheme adopted pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/881 shall be presumed to be in conformity with the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Annex I in so far as the EU statement of conformity or European cybersecurity certificate, or parts thereof, cover those requirements. 9 The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 61 of this Regulation to supplement this Regulation by specifying the European cybersecurity certification schemes adopted pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/881 that can be used to demonstrate conformity of products with digital elements with the essential cybersecurity requirements or parts thereof as set out in Annex I to this Regulation. Furthermore, the issuance of a European cybersecurity certificate issued under such schemes, at least at assurance level ‘substantial‘, eliminates the obligation of a manufacturer to carry out a third-party conformity assessment for the corresponding requirements, as set out in Article 32(2), points (a) and (b), and Article 32(3), points (a) and (b), of this Regulation.</p>

        <p>1 For the purposes of notification, a conformity assessment body shall meet the requirements laid down in paragraphs 2 to 12. 2 A conformity assessment body shall be established under national law and have legal personality. 3 A conformity assessment body shall be a third-party body independent of the organisation or the product with digital elements it assesses. A body belonging to a business association or professional federation representing undertakings involved in the design, development, production, provision, assembly, use or maintenance of products with digital elements which it assesses, may, on condition that its independence and the absence of any conflict of interest are demonstrated, be considered to be such a third-party body. 4 A conformity assessment body, its top level management and the personnel responsible for carrying out the conformity assessment tasks shall not be the designer, developer, manufacturer, supplier, importer, distributor, installer, purchaser, owner, user or maintainer of the products with digital elements which they assess, nor the authorised representative of any of those parties. This shall not preclude the use of assessed products that are necessary for the operations of the conformity assessment body or the use of such products for personal purposes. A conformity assessment body, its top level management and the personnel responsible for carrying out the conformity assessment tasks shall not be directly involved in the design, development, production, import, distribution, the marketing, installation, use or maintenance of the products with digital elements which they assess, or represent the parties engaged in those activities. They shall not engage in any activity that may conflict with their independence of judgement or integrity in relation to conformity assessment activities for which they are notified. This shall in particular apply to consultancy services. Conformity assessment bodies shall ensure that the activities of their subsidiaries or subcontractors do not affect the confidentiality, objectivity or impartiality of their conformity assessment activities. 5 Conformity assessment bodies and their personnel shall carry out the conformity assessment activities with the highest degree of professional integrity and the requisite technical competence in the specific field and shall be free from all pressures and inducements, particularly financial, which might influence their judgement or the results of their conformity assessment activities, especially as regards persons or groups of persons with an interest in the results of those activities. 6 A conformity assessment body shall be capable of carrying out all the conformity assessment tasks referred to in Annex VIII and in relation to which it has been notified, regardless of whether those tasks are carried out by the conformity assessment body itself or on its behalf and under its responsibility. At all times and for each conformity assessment procedure and each kind or category of products with digital elements in relation to which it has been notified, a conformity assessment body shall have at its disposal the necessary:(a)personnel with technical knowledge and sufficient and appropriate experience to perform the conformity assessment tasks;(b)descriptions of procedures in accordance with which conformity assessment is to be carried out, ensuring the transparency of and ability to reproduce those procedures. It shall have appropriate policies and procedures in place that distinguish between tasks it carries out as a notified body and other activities;(c)procedures for the performance of activities which take due account of the size of an undertaking, the sector in which it operates, its structure, the degree of complexity of the product technology in question and the mass or serial nature of the production process. A conformity assessment body shall have the means necessary to perform the technical and administrative tasks connected with the conformity assessment activities in an appropriate manner and shall have access to all necessary equipment or facilities. 7 The personnel responsible for carrying out conformity assessment activities shall have the following:(a)sound technical and vocational training covering all the conformity assessment activities in relation to which the conformity assessment body has been notified;(b)satisfactory knowledge of the requirements of the assessments they carry out and adequate authority to carry out those assessments;(c)appropriate knowledge and understanding of the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Annex I, of the applicable harmonised standards and common specifications, and of the relevant provisions of Union harmonisation legislation and implementing acts;(d)the ability to draw up certificates, records and reports demonstrating that assessments have been carried out. 8 The impartiality of the conformity assessment bodies, their top level management and of the assessment personnel shall be guaranteed.

        <heading>Article 52 Market surveillance and control of products with digital elements in the Union market</heading>
        <content>
        <p>1 Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 shall apply to products with digital elements that fall within the scope of this Regulation. 2 Each Member State shall designate one or more market surveillance authorities for the purpose of ensuring the effective implementation of this Regulation. Member States may designate an existing or new authority to act as market surveillance authority for this Regulation. 3 The market surveillance authorities designated under paragraph 2 of this Article shall also be responsible for carrying out market surveillance activities in relation to the obligations for open-source software stewards laid down in Article 24. Where a market surveillance authority finds that an open-source software steward does not comply with the obligations set out in that Article, it shall require the open-source software steward to ensure that all appropriate corrective actions are taken. Open-source software stewards shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of their obligations under this Regulation. 4 Where relevant, the market surveillance authorities shall cooperate with the national cybersecurity certification authorities designated pursuant to Article 58 of Regulation (EU) 2019/881 and exchange information on a regular basis. With respect to the supervision of the implementation of the reporting obligations pursuant to Article 14 of this Regulation, the designated market surveillance authorities shall cooperate and exchange information on a regular basis with the CSIRTs designated as coordinators and ENISA. 5 The market surveillance authorities may request a CSIRT designated as coordinator or ENISA to provide technical advice on matters related to the implementation and enforcement of this Regulation. When conducting an investigation under Article 54, market surveillance authorities may request the CSIRT designated as coordinator or ENISA to provide an analysis to support evaluations of compliance of products with digital elements. 6 Where relevant, the market surveillance authorities shall cooperate with other market surveillance authorities designated on the basis of Union harmonisation legislation other than this Regulation, and exchange information on a regular basis. 7 Market surveillance authorities shall cooperate, as appropriate, with the authorities supervising Union data protection law. Such cooperation includes informing those authorities of any finding relevant for the fulfilment of their competences, including when issuing guidance and advice pursuant to paragraph 10 if such guidance and advice concerns the processing of personal data. Authorities supervising Union data protection law shall have the power to request and access any documentation created or maintained under this Regulation when access to that documentation is necessary for the fulfilment of their tasks. They shall inform the designated market surveillance authorities of the Member State concerned of any such request. 8 Member States shall ensure that the designated market surveillance authorities are provided with adequate financial and technical resources, including, where appropriate, processing automation tools, as well as with human resources with the necessary cybersecurity skills to fulfil their tasks under this Regulation. 9 The Commission shall encourage and facilitate the exchange of experience between designated market surveillance authorities. 10 Market surveillance authorities may provide guidance and advice to economic operators on the implementation of this Regulation, with the support of the Commission and, where appropriate, CSIRTs and ENISA. 11 Market surveillance authorities shall inform consumers of where to submit complaints that could indicate non-compliance with this Regulation, in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, and shall provide information to consumers on where and how to access mechanisms to facilitate reporting of vulnerabilities, incidents and cyber threats that may affect products with digital elements. 12 Market surveillance authorities shall facilitate, where relevant, the cooperation with relevant stakeholders, including scientific, research and consumer organisations. 13 The market surveillance authorities shall report to the Commission on an annual basis the outcomes of relevant market surveillance activities. The designated market surveillance authorities shall report, without delay, to the Commission and relevant national competition authorities any information identified in the course of market surveillance activities that may be of potential interest for the application of Union competition law. 14 For products with digital elements that fall within the scope of this Regulation which are classified as high-risk AI systems pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, the market surveillance authorities designated for the purposes of that Regulation shall be the authorities responsible for market surveillance activities required under this Regulation. The market surveillance authorities designated pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 shall cooperate, as appropriate, with the market surveillance authorities designated pursuant to this Regulation and, with respect to the supervision of the implementation of the reporting obligations pursuant to Article 14 of this Regulation, with the CSIRTs designated as coordinators and ENISA. Market surveillance authorities designated pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 shall in particular inform market surveillance authorities designated pursuant to this Regulation of any finding relevant for the fulfilment of their tasks in relation to the implementation of this Regulation. 15 ADCO shall be established for the uniform application of this Regulation, pursuant to Article 30(2) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020. ADCO shall be composed of representatives of the designated market surveillance authorities and, if appropriate, representatives of single liaison offices. ADCO shall also address specific matters related to the market surveillance activities in relation to the obligations placed on open-source software stewards. 16 Market surveillance authorities shall monitor how manufacturers have applied the criteria referred to in Article 13(8) when determining the support period of their products with digital elements. ADCO shall publish in a publicly accessible and user-friendly form relevant statistics on categories of products with digital elements, including average support periods, as determined by the manufacturer pursuant to Article 13(8), as well as provide guidance that includes indicative support periods for categories of products with digital elements. Where the data suggests inadequate support periods for specific categories of products with digital elements, ADCO may issue recommendations to market surveillance authorities to focus their activities on such categories of products with digital elements.</p>

        <heading>Article 54 Procedure at national level concerning products with digital elements presenting a significant cybersecurity risk</heading>
        <content>
        <p>1 Where the market surveillance authority of a Member State has sufficient reason to consider that a product with digital elements, including its vulnerability handling, presents a significant cybersecurity risk, it shall, without undue delay and, where appropriate, in cooperation with the relevant CSIRT, carry out an evaluation of the product with digital elements concerned in respect of its compliance with all the requirements laid down in this Regulation. The relevant economic operators shall cooperate with the market surveillance authority as necessary. Where, in the course of that evaluation, the market surveillance authority finds that the product with digital elements does not comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation, it shall without delay require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate corrective actions to bring the product with digital elements into compliance with those requirements, to withdraw it from the market, or to recall it within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the cybersecurity risk, as the market surveillance authority may prescribe. The market surveillance authority shall inform the relevant notified body accordingly. Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 shall apply to the corrective actions. 2 When determining the significance of a cybersecurity risk referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the market surveillance authorities shall also consider non-technical risk factors, in particular those established as a result of Union level coordinated security risk assessments of critical supply chains carried out in accordance with Article 22 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555. Where a market surveillance authority has sufficient reason to consider that a product with digital elements presents a significant cybersecurity risk in light of non-technical risk factors, it shall inform the competent authorities designated or established pursuant to Article 8 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555 and cooperate with those authorities as necessary. 3 Where the market surveillance authority considers that non-compliance is not restricted to its national territory, it shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of the results of the evaluation and of the actions which it has required the economic operator to take. 4 The economic operator shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all the products with digital elements concerned that it has made available on the market throughout the Union. 5 Where the economic operator does not take adequate corrective action within the period referred to in paragraph 1, second subparagraph, the market surveillance authority shall take all appropriate provisional measures to prohibit or restrict that product with digital elements from being made available on its national market, to withdraw it from that market or to recall it. That authority shall notify the Commission and the other Member States, without delay, of those measures. 6 The information referred to in paragraph 5 shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the non-compliant product with digital elements, the origin of that product with digital elements, the nature of the alleged non-compliance and the risk involved, the nature and duration of the national measures taken and the arguments put forward by the relevant economic operator. In particular, the market surveillance authority shall indicate whether the non-compliance is due to one or more of the following:(a)a failure of the product with digital elements or of the processes put in place by the manufacturer to meet the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Annex I;(b)shortcomings in the harmonised standards, European cybersecurity certification schemes or common specifications, as referred to in Article 27. 7 The market surveillance authorities of the Member States other than the market surveillance authority of the Member State initiating the procedure shall without delay inform the Commission and the other Member States of any measures adopted and of any additional information at their disposal relating to the non-compliance of the product with digital elements concerned, and, in the event of disagreement with the notified national measure, of their objections. 8 Where, within three months of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article, no objection has been raised by either a Member State or the Commission in respect of a provisional measure taken by a Member State, that measure shall be deemed to be justified. This is without prejudice to the procedural rights of the economic operator concerned in accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020. 9 The market surveillance authorities of all Member States shall ensure that appropriate restrictive measures are taken in respect of the product with digital elements concerned, such as withdrawal of that product from their market, without delay.</p>

On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide whether the national measure is justified or not within nine months from the notification referred to in Article 54(5) and notify that decision to the Member State concerned. 2 If the national measure is considered to be justified, all Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the non-compliant product with digital elements is withdrawn from their market, and shall inform the Commission accordingly. If the national measure is not considered to be justified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw the measure. 3 Where the national measure is considered to be justified and the non-compliance of the product with digital elements is attributed to shortcomings in the harmonised standards, the Commission shall apply the procedure provided for in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012. 4 Where the national measure is considered to be justified and the non-compliance of the product with digital elements is attributed to shortcomings in a European cybersecurity certification scheme as referred to in Article 27, the Commission shall consider whether to amend or repeal any delegated act adopted pursuant to Article 27(9) that specifies the presumption of conformity concerning that certification scheme. 5 Where the national measure is considered to be justified and the non-compliance of the product with digital elements is attributed to shortcomings in common specifications as referred to in Article 27, the Commission shall consider whether to amend or repeal any implementing act adopted pursuant to Article 27(2) setting out those common specifications.</p>

The Commission shall also consider the relevance of the identified risks for that product with digital elements in view of its tasks regarding the Union level coordinated security risk assessments of critical supply chains provided for in Article 22 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555, and consult, as necessary, the Cooperation Group established pursuant to Article 14 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555 and ENISA. 3 In circumstances which justify an immediate intervention to preserve the proper functioning of the internal market and where the Commission has sufficient reason to consider that the product with digital elements referred to in paragraph 1 remains non-compliant with the requirements laid down in this Regulation and no effective measures have been taken by the relevant market surveillance authorities, the Commission shall carry out an evaluation of compliance and may request ENISA to provide an analysis to support it. The Commission shall inform the relevant market surveillance authorities accordingly. The relevant economic operators shall cooperate with ENISA as necessary. 4 Based on the evaluation referred to in paragraph 3, the Commission may decide that a corrective or restrictive measure is necessary at Union level.

        <heading>Article 57 Compliant products with digital elements which present a significant cybersecurity risk</heading>
        <content>
        <p>1 The market surveillance authority of a Member State shall require an economic operator to take all appropriate measures where, having performed an evaluation under Article 54, it finds that although a product with digital elements and the processes put in place by the manufacturer are in compliance with this Regulation, they present a significant cybersecurity risk as well as a risk to:(a)the health or safety of persons;(b)the compliance with obligations under Union or national law intended to protect fundamental rights;(c)the availability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality of services offered using an electronic information system by essential entities as referred to in Article 3(1) of Directive (EU) 2022/2555; or(d)other aspects of public interest protection. The measures referred to in the first subparagraph may include measures to ensure that the product with digital elements concerned and the processes put in place by the manufacturer no longer present the relevant risks when made available on the market, withdrawal from the market of the product with digital elements concerned, or recalling of it, and shall be commensurate with the nature of those risks. 2 The manufacturer or other relevant economic operators shall ensure that corrective action is taken in respect of the products with digital elements concerned that they have made available on the market throughout the Union within the timeline established by the market surveillance authority of the Member State referred to in paragraph 1. 3 The Member State shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States about the measures taken pursuant to paragraph 1. That information shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the products with digital elements concerned, the origin and the supply chain of those products with digital elements, the nature of the risk involved and the nature and duration of the national measures taken. 4 The Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator and shall evaluate the national measures taken. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide whether the measure is justified or not and, where necessary, propose appropriate measures. 5 The Commission shall address the decision referred to in paragraph 4 to the Member States. 6 Where the Commission has sufficient reason to consider, including based on information provided by ENISA, that a product with digital elements, although compliant with this Regulation, presents the risks referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, it shall inform and may request the relevant market surveillance authority or authorities to carry out an evaluation and follow the procedures referred to in Article 54 and in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article. 7 In circumstances which justify an immediate intervention to preserve the proper functioning of the internal market and where the Commission has sufficient reason to consider that the product with digital elements referred to in paragraph 6 continues to present the risks referred to in paragraph 1, and no effective measures have been taken by the relevant national market surveillance authorities, the Commission shall carry out an evaluation of the risks presented by that product with digital elements and may request ENISA to provide an analysis to support that evaluation and shall inform the relevant market surveillance authorities accordingly. The relevant economic operators shall cooperate with ENISA as necessary. 8 Based on the evaluation referred to in paragraph 7, the Commission may establish that a corrective or restrictive measure is necessary at Union level. To that end, it shall without delay consult the Member States concerned and the relevant economic operator or operators. 9 On the basis of the consultation referred to in paragraph 8 of this Article, the Commission may adopt implementing acts to decide on corrective or restrictive measures at Union level, including requiring the products with digital elements concerned to be withdrawn from the market, or recalled, within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 62(2). 10 The Commission shall immediately communicate the implementing acts referred to in paragraph 9 to the relevant economic operator or operators.
