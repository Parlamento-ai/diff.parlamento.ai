                  </span><span> (the “e-Commerce Directive”), new and innovative information society (digital) services have emerged, changing the daily lives of Union citizens and shaping and transforming how they communicate, connect, consume and do business. Those services have contributed deeply to societal and economic transformations in the Union and across the world. At the same time, the use of those services has also become the source of new risks and challenges, both for society as a whole and individuals using such services. Digital services can support achieving Sustainable Development Goals by contributing to economic, social and environmental sustainability. The coronavirus crisis has shown the importance of digital technologies in all aspects of modern life. It has clearly shown the dependency of our economy and society on digital services and highlighted both the benefits and the risks stemming from the current framework for the functioning of digital services.</span>

                  </span><span>, the Commission committed to update the horizontal rules that define the responsibilities and obligations of providers of digital services, and online platforms in particular. </span>
               </p>
            </div>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In doing so, the Commission has taken account of the issues identified in the European Parliament’s own initiative reports and analysed the proposals therein.</span><span> The European Parliament adopted two resolutions on the basis of Article 225 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) on the ‘Digital Services Act – Improving the functioning of the Single Market’</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">3</a>

                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">4</a>
               </span><span>. The European Parliament also adopted a resolution under the non-legislative procedure on the ‘Digital Services Act and fundamental rights issues posed’</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">5</a>
               </span><span>. </span><span>In substance, the resolutions are complementary in many aspects. They include a strong call for maintaining the core principles of the e-Commerce Directive and for protecting fundamental rights in the online environment, as well as online anonymity wherever technically possible. They call for transparency, information obligations and accountability for digital services providers and advocate for effective obligations to tackle illegal content online. They also advocate for public oversight at EU and national level, and cooperation between competent authorities across jurisdictions in enforcing the law, especially when addressing cross-border matters. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The resolution on ‘Digital Services Act – Improving the functioning of the Single Market’ calls for an ambitious reform of the existing EU e-commerce legal framework while maintaining the core principles of its liability regime, the prohibition of general monitoring and the internal market clause, which it considers to be still valid today. Confirming the objectives of the e-Commerce Directive, the resolution calls for measures which have consumer protection at their core, by including a detailed section on online marketplaces, and which ensure consumer trust in the digital economy, while respecting users’ fundamental rights. The resolution also advocates for rules to underpin a competitive digital environment in Europe, and envisages the Digital Services Act as a standard-setter at global level.  </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The resolution on ‘Digital Services Act: adapting commercial and civil law rules for commercial entities operating online’ calls for more fairness, transparency and accountability for digital services’ content moderation processes, ensuring that fundamental rights are respected, and guaranteeing independent recourse to judicial redress. The resolution also includes the request for a detailed ‘notice-and-action’ mechanism addressing illegal content, comprehensive rules about online advertising, including targeted advertising, and enabling the development and use of smart contracts.</span>

            <div class="border">
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The non-legislative resolution on the ‘Digital Services Act and fundamental rights issues posed’ highlights the need for legal clarity for platforms and users, and respect for fundamental rights given the rapid development of technology. It calls for harmonised rules for addressing illegal content online and for liability exemptions and content moderation. The resolution also includes clear reporting and transparency responsibilities for platforms and authorities.</span><span>The Council’s Conclusions</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

This call for action was reiterated in the Council’s Conclusions of 2 October 2020</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>Building on the key principles set out in the e-Commerce Directive, which remain valid today, this proposal seeks to ensure the best conditions for the provision of innovative digital services in the internal market, to contribute to online safety and the protection of fundamental rights, and to set a robust and durable governance structure for the effective supervision of providers of intermediary services. </span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The proposal defines clear responsibilities and accountability for providers of intermediary services, and in particular online platforms, such as social media and marketplaces. By setting out clear due-diligence obligations for certain intermediary services, including notice-and-action procedures for illegal content and the possibility to challenge the platforms’ content moderation decisions, the proposal seeks to improve users’ safety online across the entire Union and improve the protection of their fundamental rights. Furthermore, an obligation for certain online platforms to receive, store and partially verify and publish information on traders using their services will ensure a safer and more transparent online environment for consumers. Recognising the particular impact of very large online platforms on our economy and society, the proposal sets a higher standard of transparency and accountability on how the providers of such platforms moderate content, on advertising and on algorithmic processes. It sets obligations to assess the risks their systems pose to develop appropriate risk management tools to protect the integrity of their services against the use of manipulative techniques. The operational threshold for service providers in scope of these obligations includes those online platforms with a significant reach in the Union, currently estimated to be amounting to more than 45 million recipients of the service. This threshold is proportionate to the risks brought by the reach of the platforms in the Union; where the Union’s population changes by a certain percentage, the Commission will adjust the number of recipients considered for the threshold, so that it consistently corresponds to 10 % of the Union’s population. Additionally, the Digital Services Act will set out a co-regulatory backstop, including building on existing voluntary initiatives.</span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The proposal maintains the liability rules for providers of intermediary services set out in the e-Commerce Directive – by now established as a foundation of the digital economy and instrumental to the protection of fundamental rights online. Those rules have been interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union, thus providing valuable clarifications and guidance. Nevertheless, to ensure an effective harmonisation across the Union and avoid legal fragmentation, it is necessary to include those rules in a Regulation. It is also appropriate to clarify some aspects of those rules to eliminate existing disincentives towards voluntary own-investigations undertaken by providers of intermediary services to ensure their users’ safety and to clarify their role from the perspective of consumers in certain circumstances. Those clarifications should help smaller, innovative providers scale up and grow by benefitting from greater legal certainty. </span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>A deeper, borderless single market for digital services requires enhanced cooperation among Member States to guarantee effective oversight and enforcement of the new rules set out in the proposed Regulation. The proposal sets clear responsibilities for the Member State supervising the compliance of service providers established in its territory with the obligations set by the proposed Regulation. This ensures the swiftest and most effective enforcement of rules and protects all EU citizens. It aims at providing the simple and clear processes for both citizens and service providers to find relief in their interactions with supervising authorities. Where systemic risks emerge across the Union, the proposed Regulation provides for supervision and enforcement at Union level. </span>

                  <span>The current EU legal framework regulating digital services is underpinned, first and foremost, by the e-Commerce Directive. This proposed Regulation is without prejudice to the e-Commerce Directive, and builds on the provisions laid down therein, notably on the internal market principle set out in Article 3. The proposed Regulation provides for a cooperation and coordination mechanism for the supervision of the obligations it imposes. With regard to the horizontal framework of the liability exemption for providers of intermediary services, this Regulation deletes Articles 12-15 in the e-Commerce Directive and reproduces them in the Regulation, maintaining the liability exemptions of such providers, as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union.</span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Depending on the legal system of each Member State and the field of law at issue, national judicial or administrative authorities may order providers of intermediary services to act against certain specific items of illegal content. Such orders, in particular where they require the provider to prevent that illegal content reappears, must be issued in compliance with Union law, in particular with the prohibition of general monitoring obligations, as interpreted </span><span>by the Court of Justice of the European Union</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">8</a>
               </span><span>. This proposal, in particular its Article 8, leaves this case-law unaffected. </span><span>This proposal should constitute the appropriate basis for the development of robust technologies to prevent the reappearance of illegal information, accompanied with the highest safeguards to avoid that lawful content is taken down erroneously; such tools could be developed on the basis of voluntary agreements between all parties concerned and should be encouraged by Member States; it is in the interest of all parties involved in the provision of intermediary services to adopt and implement such procedures; the provisions of this Regulation relating to liability should not preclude the development and effective operation, by the different interested parties, of technical systems of protection and identification and of automated recognition made possible by digital technology within the limits laid down by Regulation 2016/679.</span>

               <span>The proposed Regulation introduces a horizontal framework for all categories of content, products, services and activities on intermediary services.

               <span>Sector-specific instruments do not cover all the regulatory gaps evidenced in the impact assessment report: they do not provide fully-fledged rules on the procedural obligations related to illegal content and they only include basic rules on transparency and accountability of service providers and limited oversight mechanisms. In addition, sector-specific laws cover situations where adapted approaches are necessary. In terms of scope, they are limited from two perspectives. First, the sector-specific interventions address a small subset of issues (e.g. copyright infringements, terrorist content, child sexual abuse material or illegal hate speech, some illegal products). Second, they only cover the dissemination of such content on certain types of services (e.g. sub-set of online platforms for copyright infringements, only video-sharing platforms and only as regards audiovisual terrorist content or hate speech). However, it is important that the relationship between the new proposed Regulation and the sector-specific instruments is clarified.</span>

By way of example, the obligations set out in Directive 2010/13/EC, as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/1808, on video-sharing platform providers (“AVSMD”) as regards audiovisual content and audiovisual commercial communications will continue to apply. However, this Regulation applies to those providers to the extent that the AVSMD or other Union legal acts, such as the proposal for a Regulation on addressing the dissemination on terrorist content online, do not contain more specific provisions applicable to them. </span>

               <span>This proposal is without prejudice to the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (the General Data Protection Regulation) and other Union rules on protection of personal data and privacy of communications. For example, the measures concerning advertising on online platforms complement but do not amend existing rules on consent and the right to object to processing of personal data. They impose transparency obligations towards users of online platforms, and this information will also enable them to make use of their rights as data subjects. They also enable scrutiny by authorities and vetted researchers on how advertisements are displayed and how they are targeted.</span>

               <span>This proposal will be complemented by further actions under the European Democracy Action Plan COM(2020) 790 final, with the objective of empowering citizens and building more resilient democracies across the Union.

               <span>The primary objective of this proposal is to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, in particular in relation to the provision of cross-border digital services (more specifically, intermediary services). In line with this objective, the proposal aims to ensure harmonised conditions for innovative cross-border services to develop in the Union, by addressing and preventing the emergence of obstacles to such economic activity resulting from differences in the way national laws develop, taking into account that several Member States have legislated or intend to legislate on issues such as the removal of illegal content online, diligence, notice and action procedures and transparency. At the same time, the proposal provides for the appropriate supervision of digital services and cooperation between authorities at Union level, therefore supporting trust, innovation and growth in the internal market.</span>

               <span>Taking into account that the Internet is by its nature cross-border, the legislative efforts at national level referred to above hamper the provision and reception of services throughout the Union and are ineffective in ensuring the safety and uniform protection of the rights of Union citizens and businesses online. Harmonising the conditions for innovative cross-border digital services to develop in the Union, while maintaining a safe online environment, can only be served at Union level.</span>

               <span>Union level action provides predictability and legal certainty, and reduces compliance costs across the Union. At the same time, it fosters the equal protection of all Union citizens, by ensuring that action against illegal content online by providers of intermediary services is consistent, regardless of their place of establishment. A well coordinated supervisory system, reinforced at Union level, also ensures a coherent approach applicable to providers of intermediary services operating in all Member States.</span>

This approach addresses certain identified problems only there where they materialise, while not overburdening providers unconcerned by those problems. Certain substantive obligations are limited only to very large online platforms, which due to their reach have acquired a central, systemic role in facilitating the public debate and economic transactions. Very small providers are exempt from the obligations altogether.</span>

               <span>This proposal builds on the evaluation of the e-Commerce Directive, conducted as a ‘back to back’ evaluation with the Impact Assessment accompanying the proposal. The specific objectives of the e-Commerce Directive were to ensure (i) a well-functioning internal market for digital services, (ii) the effective removal of illegal content online in full respect of fundamental rights, and (iii) an adequate level of information and transparency for consumers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>As regards the </span><span>effectiveness</span><span> of the e-Commerce Directive, the evaluation shows that while the e-Commerce Directive has provided an important incentive for the growth of the internal market for digital services, and enabled entry and scaling up of new providers of such services, the initial objectives have not been fully achieved. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In particular, the dynamic growth of the digital economy and the appearance of new types of service providers raises certain new challenges, dealt with differently by Member States, where the initial set of objectives need to be clarified. In addition, these developments put an additional strain on achieving already existing objectives as the increased legal fragmentation shows. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The evaluation also showed that while several new regulatory instruments make valuable contributions to the attainment of some of the policy objectives set out in the e-Commerce Directive, they provide only sector-specific solutions for some of the underlying problems (e.g. in addressing the proliferation of specific types of illegal activity). They therefore do not address such issues consistently for the entire digital ecosystem, as they are limited to certain types of services or certain types of illegal content. Furthermore, while self-regulatory initiatives have generally shown positive results, they cannot be legally enforced, nor do they cover all participants in the digital economy. As regards the </span><span>efficiency</span><span> of the e-Commerce Directive, the Directive imposed only limited additional costs for Member States' administrations and providers of information society services. The evaluation has not revealed particularly high or disproportionate costs and no substantial concerns have been raised regarding impacts on small and medium-sized enterprises. The main concern in this regard is related to the lack of clarity in the cooperation mechanism across Member States, creating burdens and duplication of costs, despite the opposite objective of the Directive, in particular where the supervision of online platforms is concerned. This has essentially reduced its efficiency in maintaining the functioning of the internal market.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In relation to questions about the continued </span><span>relevance</span><span> of the objectives pursued by the e-Commerce Directive, the evaluation shows that the objectives of the e-Commerce Directive continue to remain valid, while at the same time there are several new developments that are not well reflected in the existing public policy objectives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>First, the open public consultation, targeted submissions by stakeholders, reports issued by the European Parliament</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               </span><span> confirm that the existing principles and objectives of the e-Commerce Directive remain valid today. However, new information asymmetries and risks have arisen since the entry into force of the Directive, notably related to the emergence of online platforms, in particular very large ones, and the scale of the digital transformation. This is for example the case in the areas of algorithmic decision making (with an impact on how information flows are intermediated online), or in online advertising systems. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The evaluation showed that the e-Commerce Directive is </span><span>coherent </span><span>with other EU interventions that took place since its adoption. The evaluation also did not identify any internal in-coherence of the e-Commerce Directive.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Finally, at least parts of the actual benefits of the e-Commerce Directive that the evaluation identified could be considered as </span><span>EU added value</span><span>. It is likely that Member States would have continued applying their own regulatory systems without any common set of principles and that some Member States would have continued to have no horizontal rules in place at all. In the absence of robust evidence, it is however not possible to draw firm conclusions on the extent of this EU added value. </span>

               <span>Over the past five years, the Commission has consulted a wide range of different stakeholders, including providers of digital services such as online platforms and other intermediary services, businesses trading online, media publishers, brand owners and other businesses, social partners, users of digital services, civil society organisations, national authorities, academia, the technical community, international organisations and the general public. An array of targeted consultation steps have captured thoroughly stakeholder views on issues related to digital services and platforms over the last years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The open public consultation on the Digital Services Act was open for 14 weeks, between 2</span><span>nd</span><span> of June and 8</span><span>th</span><span> of September and received 2,863 responses and around 300 position papers from a diverse group of stakeholders. Most feedback was submitted by the general public (66% from Union citizens, 8% from non-EU citizens), companies/ businesses organizations (7.4%), business associations (6%), and NGOs (5.6%). This was followed by public authorities (2.2%), academic/research institutions (1.2%), trade unions (0.9%), and consumer and environmental organisations (0.4%).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Overall, there is a general agreement amongst stakeholders for a need for action, both in addressing online safety and in furthering the internal market for digital services. </span>

         <div class="content">

               <span>Stakeholders converge on the continued relevance of the main principles of the e-Commerce Directive</span><span> </span><span>and agree that they should be maintained, including the internal market principle for the supervision of digital services, the liability regime, and the prohibition of general monitoring obligations. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Stakeholders also broadly agree on the need to upgrade the framework in light of today’s challenges by establishing clear obligations for service providers, harmonised across the EU. A majority of respondents, all categories included, indicated that they have encountered both harmful and illegal content, goods or services online, and specifically noted an alarming spike during the Covid-19 pandemic. A large share of respondents who say they have notified illegal content or goods to digital service providers expressed their dissatisfaction with the response and the ineffectiveness of reporting mechanisms after the exposure took place. Moreover, users perceive there to be a mismatch between providers’ policies as stated and their concrete actions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>There is broad consensus, including among service providers responding to the consultation, on the need for simple, standardised, transparent notice and action obligations, harmonised across the internal market. This is considered as essential to enable rapid responses to illegal content and enhance legal clarity for users of platforms and for small platforms seeking to scale in the internal market. Respondents also agree on the importance of a redress mechanisms. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Concerning online marketplaces, several stakeholders flagged the need for more targeted measures such as the identification of sellers. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Respondents also generally agree that the territorial scope for these obligations should include all players offering goods, information or services in the Union, regardless of their place of establishment. A large share of respondents also emphasized the importance of these issues in particular where large platforms are concerned.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>There is a general agreement among stakeholders that ‘harmful’ (yet not, or at least not necessarily, illegal) content should not be defined in the Digital Services Act and should not be subject to removal obligations, as this is a delicate area with severe implications for the protection of freedom of expression. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>However, the way</span><span> </span><span>algorithmic systems shape information flows online is an area of concern among a wide category of stakeholders. Several stakeholders, in particular civil society and academics, pointed out the need for algorithmic accountability and transparency audits</span><span>, </span><span>especially with regard to how information is prioritized and targeted</span><span>.</span><span> Similarly, regarding online advertising, stakeholder views echoed the broad concerns around the lack of user empowerment and lack of meaningful oversight and enforcement. </span>

               </span><span>. The Impact Assessment report was further revised along these lines, notably in clarifying the interlinks between the Digital Services Act and the broader regulatory framework, providing more detailed descriptions of the policy options, and a more detailed analysis of the underlying evidence addressed in the revised impact assessment report. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The importance in our economy and society, but also the growing risks brought by digital services will continue to scale. In the baseline scenario, the Commission will continue to enforce existing rules, including on sector-specific issues, and will support the self-regulatory efforts in place. However, faced with the evolving problems, Member States will continue to legislate independently. The legal fragmentation with the resulting patchwork of national measures will not just fail to effectively tackle illegal activities and protect citizens’ fundamental rights throughout the EU, it will also hinder new, innovative services from scaling up in the internal market, cementing the position of the few players which can afford the additional compliance costs. This leaves the rule setting and enforcement mostly to very large private companies, with ever-growing information asymmetry between online services, their users and public authorities. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Three main policy options were assessed, in addition to the baseline. Option 1 would codify the Recommendation of 2018: it would lay down a range of procedural obligations for online platforms to tackle illegal activities conducted by their users. The obligations would also include the necessary safeguards in order to protect users’ fundamental rights and ensure transparency. It would also enhance the administrative cooperation mechanisms for authorities to resolve cross-border issues through a digital clearing house, facilitating information flows. Option 2 would in addition to measures in option 1, remove disincentives for service providers to take voluntary measures against illegal content, and introduce measures to enhance transparency around recommender systems and advertising. The enforcement and cooperation mechanism would be enhanced with the appointment of a central coordinator in each Member State. Option 3, building on the measures outlined in the previous options, includes targeted, asymmetric measures with stronger obligations for very large online platforms which are prone to the highest levels of risks for the EU society and economy, as well as certain limited clarifications of the liability regime for providers of intermediary services and an EU governance system with reinforced oversight and enforcement powers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The assessment of the economic and social impacts identified, and the comparison of its effectiveness, efficiency, coherence and proportionality showed that Option 3 would most effectively meet the objectives of the intervention by establishing the proportionate framework fit for adapting to emerging challenges in the dynamic digital world. The components included in Option 3 are also broadly supported by stakeholders, including positions from the European Parliament and Member States. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The preferred option would support the access to the internal market for European Union intermediary service providers and their ability to scale-up by reducing costs related to the legal fragmentation. While costs for compliance with due diligence obligations are expected, it is estimated this is offset by reducing the current fragmentation through harmonisation. It is expected to have a positive impact on competitiveness, innovation and investment in digital services, in particular European Union start-ups and scale-ups offering platform business models but also, to varying extents, on sectors underpinned and amplified by digital commerce. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The preferred option intends to define the appropriate division of responsibilities between intermediary services, their recipients and authorities when fighting against illegal content online. To do so, it introduces an asymmetric approach to the due diligence obligations imposed on very large online platforms: this is a supervised risk management approach, with an important role of the governance system for enforcement. The asymmetric obligations are only imposed on very large online platforms, which have, based on the current data, not only the broadest reach, but are also the large companies with important turnover. Consequently, while the targeted measures are more restrictive than for other companies, they are proportionate to the ability of the companies to comply. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>For public authorities, the proposed option would cut the costs brought by the inefficiencies and duplications in the existing set-up for the cooperation of authorities. While Member States would bear the costs of appointing a competent authority, new or already established, the efficiency gains are expected to outweigh them: for the individual authorities through mutualisation of resources, better information flows, and straight-forward processes for interacting with their counterparts across the internal market, as well as with service providers.</span>

               <span>The Impact Assessment accompanying this proposal identifies the sole added value of Union intervention addressing the risk of legal fragmentation triggered by divergent regulatory and supervisory approaches (hence without accounting for the increased safety and trust on digital services) in a possible increase of cross-border digital trade of 1 to 1.8%, i.e. the equivalent of an increase in turnover generated cross-border of EUR 8.6 billion and up to EUR 15.5 billion. </span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>With regard to added value in the enforcement of measures, the initiative creates important efficiency gains in the cooperation across Member States and mutualising some resources for technical assistance at EU level, for inspecting and auditing content moderation systems, recommender systems and online advertising on very large online platforms. This, in turn, leads to an increased effectiveness of enforcement and supervision measures, whereas the current system relies to a large extent on the limited capability for supervision in a small number of Member States. </span>

            <div class="border">
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>Union citizens and others are exposed to ever-increasing risks and harms online – from the spread of illegal content and activities, to limitations to express themselves and other societal harms. The envisaged policy measures in this legislative proposal will substantially improve this situation by providing a modern, future-proof governance framework, effectively safeguarding the rights and legitimate interests of all parties involved, most of all Union citizens. The proposal introduces important safeguards to allow citizens to freely express themselves, while enhancing user agency in the online environment, as well as the exercise of other fundamental rights such as the right to an effective remedy, non-discrimination, rights of the child as well as the protection of personal data and privacy online.</span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The proposed Regulation will mitigate risks of erroneous or unjustified blocking speech, address the chilling effects on speech, stimulate the freedom to receive information and hold opinions, as well as reinforce users’ redress possibilities. Specific groups or persons may be </span><span>vulnerable or disadvantaged in their use of online services because of their gender, race or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. They can be disproportionately affected by restrictions and removal measures following from (unconscious or conscious) biases potentially embedded in the notification systems by users and third parties, as w</span><span>ell as replicated in automated content moderation tools used by platforms. The proposal will mitigate discriminatory risks, particularly for those groups or persons and will contribute to the protection of the rights of the child and the right to human dignity online. The proposal will only require removal of illegal content and will impose mandatory safeguards when users’ information is removed, including the provision of explanatory information to the user, complaint mechanisms supported by the service providers as well as external out-of-court dispute resolution mechanism. Furthermore, it will ensure EU citizens are also protected when using services provided by providers not established in the Union but active on the internal market, since those providers are covered too. </span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>With regard to service providers’ freedom to conduct a business, the costs incurred on businesses are offset by reducing fragmentation across the internal market. The proposal introduces safeguards to alleviate the burden on service providers, including measures against repeated unjustified notices and prior vetting of trusted flaggers by public authorities. Furthermore, certain obligations are targeted to very large online platforms, where the most serious risks often occur and which have the capacity absorb the additional burden. </span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The proposed legislation will preserve the prohibition of general monitoring obligations of the e-Commerce Directive, which in itself is crucial to the required fair balance of fundamental rights in the online world. The new Regulation prohibits general monitoring obligations, as they could disproportionately limit users’ freedom of expression and freedom to receive information, and could burden service providers excessively and thus unduly interfere with their freedom to conduct a business. The prohibition also limits incentives for online surveillance and has positive implications for the protection of personal data and privacy.</span>

The Section lays down the obligation for online platforms to provide an internal complaint-handling system in respect of decisions taken in relation to alleged illegal content or information incompatible with their terms and conditions (Article 17). It also obliges online platforms to engage with certified out-of-court dispute settlement bodies to resolve any dispute with users of their services (Article 18). It further obliges online platforms to ensure that notices submitted by entities granted the status of trusted flaggers are treated with priority (Article 19) and sets out the measures online platforms are to adopt against misuse (Article 20). Furthermore, this Section includes a requirement for online platforms to inform competent enforcement authorities in the event they become aware of any information giving rise to a suspicion of serious criminal offences involving a threat to the life or safety of persons (Article 21). The Section also obliges online platforms to receive, store, make reasonable efforts to assess the reliability of and publish specific information on the traders using their services where those online platforms allow consumers to conclude distance contracts with those traders (Article 22). Those online platforms are also obliged to organise their interface in a way that enables traders to respect Union consumer and product safety law (Article 22a).

The Regulation sets also a limitation period for the imposition of penalties (Article 61) and for their enforcement (Article 62). Finally, the Regulation sets the procedural guarantees in front of the Commission, in particular the right to be heard and of access to the file (Article 63) and the publication of decisions (Article 64).

This includes coordinated operations aimed at amplifying information, including disinformation, such as the use of bots or fake accounts for the creation of fake or misleading information, sometimes with a purpose of obtaining economic gain, which are particularly harmful for vulnerable recipients of the service, such as children. In relation to such areas, adherence to and compliance with a given code of conduct by a very large online platform may be considered as an appropriate risk mitigating measure. The refusal without proper explanations by an online platform of the Commission’s invitation to participate in the application of such a code of conduct could be taken into account, where relevant, when determining whether the online platform has infringed the obligations laid down by this Regulation.</span>

                  <span>The E-commerce Directive 2000/31/EC provides the core framework for the functioning of the single market and the supervision of digital services and sets a basic structure for a general cooperation mechanism among Member States , covering in principle all requirements applicable to digital services. The evaluation of the Directive pointed to shortcomings in several aspects of this cooperation mechanism , including important procedural aspects such as the lack of clear timeframes for response from Member States coupled with a general lack of responsiveness to requests from their counterparts. This has led over the years to a lack of trust between Member States in addressing concerns about providers offering digital services cross-border, in particular in what concerns online platforms. Member States have instead regulated independently, in particular in imposing different rules covering obligations for online platforms and other online intermediaries as regards illegal content, goods or services providers by their users. This legal fragmentation has serious repercussions both on the ability of European service providers to scale in the single market, and on the protection and safety online of EU citizens. The evaluation of the Directive and the impact assessment showed the need to define a differentiated set of rules and requirements at European level, including specific obligations for very large platforms, which would require appropriate and consistent supervisory tools and mechanisms at European level. For this reason the implementation of the specific obligations laid down in this Regulation would require a specific cooperation mechanism at EU level, with a governance structure ensuring coordinator of specific responsible bodies at EU level, and a reinforced and agile EU level supervision of very large online platforms. </span>

In addition to that, several monitoring actions should be carried out by the Commission, possibly upon advise of the Board, in evaluating continuously the effectiveness and efficiency of the measures, in the context of the application of the measures, including supervision and analysis of emerging issues. </span>

These new rules require also a consistency mechanism for the cross-border application of the obligations under this Regulation, a new advisory group coordinating the activities of national authorities and of the Commission as well as direct enforcement powers for the Commission and the set-up of an information system facilitating information flows between Digital Services Coordinators.</span>
