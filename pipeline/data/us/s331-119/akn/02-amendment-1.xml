For purposes of paragraph (1), except as provided in paragraph (3), the term fentanyl-related substance means any substance that is structurally related to fentanyl by 1 or more of the following modifications: By replacement of the phenyl portion of the phenethyl group by any monocycle, whether or not further substituted in or on the monocycle. By substitution in or on the phenethyl group with alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxyl, hydroxyl, halo, haloalkyl, amino, or nitro groups. By substitution in or on the piperidine ring with alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxyl, ester, ether, hydroxyl, halo, haloalkyl, amino, or nitro groups. By replacement of the aniline ring with any aromatic monocycle whether or not further substituted in or on the aromatic monocycle. By replacement of the N–propionyl group with another acyl group. A substance that satisfies the definition of the term fentanyl-related substance in paragraph (2) shall nonetheless not be treated as a fentanyl-related substance subject to this schedule if the substance— is controlled by action of the Attorney General under section 201; or is otherwise expressly listed in a schedule other than this schedule.
