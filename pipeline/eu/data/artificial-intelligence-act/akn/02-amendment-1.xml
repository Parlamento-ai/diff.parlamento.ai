Paragraph 1 is without prejudice to obligations set up by existing Union and national law. For high-risk AI systems, the general principles are translated into and complied with by providers or deployers by means of the requirements set out in Articles 8 to 15, and the relevant obligations laid down in Chapter 3 of Title III of this Regulation. For foundation models, the general principles are translated into and complied with by providers by means of the requirements set out in Articles 28 to 28b. For all AI systems, the application of the principles referred to in paragraph 1 can be achieved, as applicable, through the provisions of Article 28, Article 52, or the application of harmonised standards, technical specifications, and codes of conduct as referred to in Article 69,without creating new obligations under this Regulation. 3. The Commission and the AI Office shall incorporate these guiding principles in standardisation requests as well as recommendations consisting in technical guidance to assist providers and deployers on how to develop and use AI systems. European Standardisation Organisations shall take the general principles referred to in paragraph 1of this Article into account as outcome-based objectives when developing the appropriate harmonised standards for high risk AI systems as referred to in Article 40(2b).</akndiff:new>

A contractual term concerning the supply of tools, services, components or processes that are used or integrated in a high risk AI system or the remedies for the breach or the termination of related obligations which has been unilaterally imposed by an enterprise on a SME or startup shall not be binding on the latter enterprise if it is unfair. 2. A contractual term is not to be considered unfair where it arises from applicable Union law. 3. A contractual term is unfair if it is of such a nature that it objectively impairs the ability of the party upon whom the term has been unilaterally imposed to protect its legitimate commercial interest in the information in question or its use grossly deviates from good commercial practice in the supply of tools, services, components or processes that are used or integrated in a high-risk AI system, contrary to good faith and fair dealing or creates a significant imbalance between the rights and the obligations of the parties in the contract. A contractual term is also unfair if it has the effect of shifting penalties referred to in Article 71 or associated litigation costs across parties to the contract, as referred to in Article 71(8). 4. A contractual term is unfair for the purposes of this Article if its object or effect is to: (a) exclude or limit the liability of the party that unilaterally imposed the term for intentional acts or gross negligence; (b) exclude the remedies available to the party upon whom the term has been unilaterally imposed in the case of non-performance of contractual obligations or the liability of the party that unilaterally imposed the term in the case of a breach of those obligations; (c) give the party that unilaterally imposed the term the exclusive right to determine whether the technical documentation, information supplied are in conformity with the contract or to interpret any term of the contract. 5. A contractual term shall be considered to be unilaterally imposed within the meaning of this Article if it has been supplied by one contracting party and the other contracting party has not been able to influence its content despite an attempt to negotiate it. The contracting party that supplied a contractual term shall bears the burden of proving that that term has not been unilaterally imposed. 6. Where the unfair contractual term is severable from the remaining terms of the contract, those remaining terms shall remain binding. The party that supplied the contested term shall not argue that the term is an unfair term. 7. This Article shall apply to all new contracts entered into force after … [date of entry into force of this Regulation].
